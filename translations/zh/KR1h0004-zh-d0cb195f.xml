It is a short chapter, and was probablycompiled more as a controversial position than as a calm, inner-determinedrepertoire of sayings. The controversy in question is the classic one: whetherto serve an illegitimate ruler (which at this juncture would likely have been theChu-dominated Prince of Lu), to which the classic answer (see 4:5) was "No."On that question, LY 18 takes a brilliantly nonclassical position (see 18:6),consistent with the more recent line of political theory: now that the state canbe conceived separately from the ruler, as something with its own needs andloyalty focus, the ruler's credentials, still decisive in 17:4/6, no longer count.The larger needs of human society are the determining concern.This chapter, and associated interpolations in other chapters, was writtenbefore the partial Chu conquest of Lu brought Sywndz directly on the sceneas the military governor of occupied Lu, and the intellectual nemesis of Lu.Though much of interest can be detected in the covert sayings of LY 19-20,it has to be read between the lines. LY 18 is the last free Analects chapter.The numbering of passages is identical in the Legge text.【These lore passages encapsulate LY 18 as the concentric additions to LY 8,above, surrounded that chapter. They are probably close in date to the LY 8lore passages; at the least, all must follow rather than precede the LY 18 core.Such equations might be used to divide these interpolations into multiple strata( compare the interpolations in LY 15). As a beginning in this direction we havetentatively dated the LY 18 and other lore passages to c0260 rather than c0262.】</seg>

The major new detail is the implicationthat Confucius should have been treated with the ceremonies due the head ofthe Ji; in other words, as a virtual head of state.

There isabsolutely no warrant for accepting this as historical. It is in the pattern of rulerencounters established by the historical Mencius, and here grafted onto theevolving myth of Confucius. It must not be forgotten by analysts of the Analectsthat the Mencians were a rival school, and the prominence of their founder seta standard for Confucians that the Lu group could not afford to ignore. Thedeparture of Confucius in 18:4 (compare 15: 1/2) may be seen as imitating thatof Mencius from Chi following the Yen incident, the propriety of which isdebated endlessly throughout the Mencius text (for example MC 2Bl 1-12;Legge Mencius 228f ). This defense had apparently confirmed departure as theseemly response. In any case, Confucius here does it too.】</seg>

It changes a detail at the end of the otherwise identically quoted anecdote. The new detail is Confucius's attempt to refute the criticism, and the unwillingness of the critic to stand his ground; its implied meaning is the Madman's lack of courage. Those who are only looking to save their own skins are of no use to others, or to the state.

This counter-anecdote uses phrases fromJZ 9:1, 12:5 and 12:9b (Watson Chuang 105, 131 “proceeded with work,”134f) and inspires a rejoinder in JZ 20:4, where Confucius is depicted as givingup his principles and living happily with birds and beasts (Watson 213f). Thenames of the primitivist hermits (compare MC 3A4 and Graham Tillers)exaggerate those given to Jwangdz characters. The point of 18:6 is that it isprecisely the danger that creates the obligation. Humankind, such as it is, is allthat human beings can validly labor for. That this eloquent appeal was not loston the JZ 4 people is shown by the fact that later parts of that chapter advocaterejoining the dangerous world (Brooks Jwangdz 4; see also page 258 below).The covert meaning of “ask about the ford” is “seek for a way out of thechaos of the times.” The literary hermit Tau Chyén (372-427) ended hisfamous “Peachblossom Fountain Preface” allegory with the line, “Since then,there has been no one to ask about the ford.” This is a twinge of conscience;a sense that his own hermit life in evil times fell short of this imperative.】</seg>

Only at the end, when the hermit is found to have run away,do our sympathies turn. The parallel with 18:5 suggests an outside source,which (or an analogue of which; not all the Jwangdz has come down to us) may be JZ 25:6 (Watson Chuang 285f). The peroration, and thus the moral,is a more spelled-out version of the one in 18:6.The 18:5—7 series consists of what we may call a split pair, with 18:5 and18:7 parallel stories based on Jwangdz originals, separated (split) by a freely invented story on the same theme, but not as close to either of the flanking stories as they are to each other. This would suggest that the middle piece is an interpolation, and in previous chapters such a situation has been so interpreted.We note, however, that once the ABA interpolated triplet (examples include3-4-6, with *3:5"* splitting a Lin Fang pair 3:4/6, or the very recent 17:4/6, on improper offers, which are to be split by the self-interpolated * 17:58 passage grouped with this chapter) has become familiar through memorization and repetition, it is only a question of time before the ABA structure, like the AA structure of the basic pairing pattern, comes to be seen as valid in its own right. We assume that this stage has been reached with this triplet, directly inspired by Dz-shvn’s own prior interpolation of the ministerial * 17:5'8 between the anti-ministerial 17:4/6. It seems to us that the ABA framing structure here gives,and was meant to give, an architectural prominence to the central 18:6.】</seg>

Lu court music is however implicit in the interview with a Lt Grand Preceptor, 3:23 (c0342); these two passages attest musical growth in Lu over the period c0450-c0342. But a pious school head, referring both to the time of Confucius, might have thought to reconcile 3:23 (implying court music in Lu) and 7:14 (attesting it in Chi) by creating a link in *18:9(where a Lu musician goes to Chi, establishing Chi music from a Lu source).】</seg>

By thus keeping up with the latest literary techniques, the Analects people showed themselves worthy of a continued part in the fray.】【LY 18 (c0262): Reflections There was a tactical dilemma facing the Analects writers at this period. Direct rebuttals to Jwangdz (as in 18:5—7) violated the historical convention of the Analects, and like any rebuttal gave the attacker more visibility. A safer tactic was to avoid contemporary polemic and put the argument beyond debate by basing it on ancient history, as is done in the bits of lore attached to LY 18 and other 03c chapters (noticed by Tswé1 Shu as one trait of these chapters).But rival schools could make up lore too, leading to the taunt of the Micians to the Confucians, in the race to forge speeches of ever more ancient kings,“Your antiquity isn’t old enough” (MZ 48:4, from c0285; Mei Ethical 233).Schneider (Madman 17f and 42f) observes that the emblematic figures ofBwé-yi and Shi-chi figure in an aristocratic framework, whereas the Madman of Chi in 18:5 is from the world of the minister. The transition in the Analects is from 16:7, where Bwo-yi and Shi-chi are still revered, via the agonizingreappraisal of LY 17, to * 18:8b, where Confucius distances himself from them.But the principled recluses of *18:8a continued as a type; see the early Han Four Ancients of SJ 55 (4/2044-2047; Watson Records 1/ 146-149). ...continued next line</seg>

For three years (0257-0255) he had been the oldest member and ex officio libationer atthe revived Ji-sya establishment in Chi, but his position there had become difficult, perhaps due to friction with colleagues representing earlier Chithought (SJ 74, Nienhauser Records 7/184). He thus moved to Lan-ling, and established a school that would last until his Chu patron died in 0238, and would exert a profound influence on Confucianism well into the Han dynasty.Northern Lu was not occupied, but its affairs were effectively controlled from Lan-ling. The Analects, with Dz-shvn continuing as head, responds to Sywndz with defiance (the main chapter) but also interest (the interpolations made at that time in other chapters). LY 19 has a subtly satirical dimension,and, like all underground literature, can be hard to decode in later ages. It is made up of sayings by five disciples, three of them criticized by the others.Those three disapprove errors that may be emphases of the Sywndzian school,and their squabbling may be a caricature of Sywndz^ own contentiousness: attacks on other viewpoints fill substantial stretches of the Sywndzian writings.    The numbering of passages is identical in the Legge text.】</seg>

This again dealswith those who would disparage Confucius； here, their tactic is not to attackConfucius, but to praise Dz-gung (Sz), who, as we have seen in ll：18b, wasreputed to be rich. The reply is that Dz-gung*s virtues are obvious to all, butthe higher virtues of Confucius are visible only to those who “find the gate” byunderstanding his teachings. That only his intimates appreciate Confucius^virtues implies that those virtues are not public, and the sacrificial touches inthe comparison further support the implication that they are rather mystical.Sywndz did not possess the lineal tradition of Confucius, but specializedinstead in the learned explication of texts which had come to be associated withConfucius. He rarely quotes Confucius, but regularly quotes the Shr and Shu.The gibe at Confucius in 19:22 may be Sywndzian ridicule of the Lu lack ofa transmitted text “tradition.” The Lu response is that the culture, as preservedby its own people, is their tradition. This is followed in 19:23 by the crusher“few indeed are those who find that gate」' So much for Sywndz.】</seg>

The sense of the sentence is the only　guide. As to the designation &lt;&lt;Jung-n^/, it is new in this chapter, though metwith in the 03c works of other schools. Conventions vary somewhat from text to text, but often “Jung・ni” is relation-neutral, unlike “Confucius”(“Master Kunng), which acknowledges his status as an authority figure. This may imply that we have here a debate among schools, not a question within one school. A final pair refuting a disparagement of Confucius which may represent the criticism of the Sywndz school.

His “achievements” figure among those attributed in LY 12-13 to the ideal ruler. The phrase “climbing to Heaven” occurs in MC 7A41 (Legge Mencius 474).The ambition of LY 17, to have some ministership, any ministership, is here calmly taken as a long-accomplished fact. The myth is growing rapidly.】</seg>
                    <seg corresp="#KR1h0004_tls_020-1a.3-h" xml:lang="en" resp="#CH" modified="2024-10-08T19:03:52.192+09:00">The following piece was a chapter by itself (LY 20) in the copy of the Analects concealed in the schoolroom wall in 0249, and rediscovered in c0154; in the present text it is combined with 20:2-3, which were originally a fragmentary 21st chapter. It owes nothing to previous Analects chapter form, but is instead in the style of the Shu； its archaic diction, lapsing from the purported words of sage rulers into historical summary, ornaments and gives sonority to a plan for the state, whose ruler is accountable to Heaven for his administration of justice, encouragement of trade, and solicitude for the people. What seems a jumble is actually a landmark document. Its date of composition might be cO251.            We may begin our examination of *20:1 by asking, where does it fit into the context of its time? Like Mencius, it envisions a universal (MFbur Quarters”) sovereignty, but looks to the continuance rather than the extirpation of local ruler lineages. This is not a revived feudalism, but rather a unified federalism (compare 13:18, which had sheltered families from the law). Along with these concessions to Legalism, we find a strong distaste for punishment, particularly punishment of the people, for whose errors the ruler is ultimately responsible. The Lu Confucians may have wanted the extirpation of Sting to be reversed, but they did not want virtue itself to be locally confined.Our search for LY 19 Legalisms (see 18r) found only *13:3, *19:13, and*20:1. The first is merely bureaucratic, the second unclear, the third benign. The hostility to Legalistic punishments is very like that of DDJ 72-75, which implies that both may be reacting to a third, Legalist presence at the Lu court. We thus infer the existence of a court Legalist faction in Lu, prior to 0255.After 0254, direct Sywndzian influence on the LY 19 theories becomes the likeliest hypothesis. Evidence for the Confucian/Legalist convergence noted by Hsiao for Han is thus best sought in the school of Sywndz, but the LY 19-20lean toward universalism may constitute a footnote to that tendency. Sywndz too must be seen in context. Warring States thought from cO32O on was collectively engaged in designing the universal political state which the Warring States technologies of war and peace were making inevitable. One item in the technology of peace, the technology of governing, is the know-how involved in controlling more than a local area. It was apparently gained from experience in administering conquered territory (see Creel Beginnings). The experience being acquired by Chu, in the LY 19 year c0253, in administering its annexed but not yet absorbed territory of southern Lu, must itself have been part of that process of refining a new technology of rule.The Dauists, who were seemingly high enough at the Lu court to be held accountable for the 0254 loss of half its territory and population, justified it as a desirable outcome in DDJ 80 (“Make the state small, make the people few,MHenricks Te 36, 156). This apologia anticipates the “inactivity” of a 4c Dauist minister (Waley Lo-yang 48-53). As for the defensive-war Micians, MZ 50(c0254； Mei Ethical 257), which relocates Mwodz from Lu to Chi, suggests that an ungrateful Lu government had dismissed them.All the LY 19 disciples can be seen as in some way criticizing Sywndz, but only the three whose mutual wrangling caricatured him drew a response from Lan-ling： an addendum to the earlier diatribe SZ 6 (Knoblock Xunzi 1/229) vilifies precisely Dz-jang, Dz-sya, and Dz-you. As for Yen Hwei, whom we have not seen in any uninterpolated passage since 12:1, he has found a new home among the Dauists (JZ 6:7, 20:7, 22:11, Watson Chuang 90f, 217f, 246f), toward whom he had from the first shown a certain predilection (see 6:23n),and with whom he is living happily ever after. On the long term                                                               ability of the LY 19-20 political proposals, de Bary(Trouble 2; compare Wakeman Remarks 21) notes that their sanctions, based                                 on paradigms of antiquity, later proved “susceptible of appropriation” by rulers.The Lu Confucians, to borrow a metaphor from JZ 4:3 (Watson Chuang 62),are here philosophizing to a steamroller.</seg>

It invokes the Jung Yung (“Mean”) as a balancing principle,and as a condition of retaining the mandate to rule.Next is Tang (“He”), founder of Shang. Behind the sacrifices, invoked from old inscriptions, is a bureaucratic concern for due process: the guilty will no tbe protected nor law officers deceived; any guilt the people incur will be considered the ruler*s fault. This is the corollary of the magic-efficacy theory of rule: the people, even if nominally guilty, are what the ruler has made them.The Jou are the ideal： meritocracy (see *18： IO18), responsibility alike for the people's livelihood (see 12:9) and misdeeds, and for a rational bureaucracy (contrast 13:20), reconciling the secluded (* 18：8a18), generosity (see *6：3018), faith (12:7, *17:518), and above all fairness. This word, gung 公，originally“Prince,” in 6:14 already “public” (see the early DDJ 16), is now "fair” - having the equitable character on which alone a public culture can rest.</seg>
