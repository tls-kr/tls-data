As a travelling monk he comes to an inn where a royal jeweller is also staying. The jeweller happens to leave a gem on a table whereupon it is eaten by a goose. Upon becoming aware of the missing gem, the jeweller blames the monk, who is aware that it was actually the goose who stole the gem. Fearful that exposure of the truth will result in the slaughter of the goose, the monk keeps silent, and is therefore bound and beaten severely. The goose, who returns to drink the blood of the bleeding monk, is killed by the jeweller, who cuts it open and finds the jewel inside. From the Kalpanā maṇḍitikā.
