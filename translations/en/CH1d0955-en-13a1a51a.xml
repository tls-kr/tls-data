It could abate when the patient is not exposed to wind. Both aversion to wind and aversion to cold are common symptoms seen in tai yang disease. Both of them would occur regardless of the presentation of external wind or cold. Neither of them would diminish by adding extra clothing or blankets. The cause for both of them are the failure of the defensive qi to warm the body surface due to attack of wind-cold.</seg>
                    <seg corresp="#CH1d0955_CHANT_005-1a.9" xml:lang="en" resp="#chris" modified="2020-12-03T09:14:53.08+09:00">2.A moderate pulse in this line is a literal translation of “緩脉 huán mài,” which is usually done in modern textbooks in Chinese medicine. Jiang Jian-Guo and Li Shu-Pei point out: \nThe application of relativity in the pulse diagnosis is one unique approach to the pulse diagnosis in Discussion of Cold Damage; the term “緩脉 huán mài” is the opposite of the term “緊脉 jǐn mài (tight pulse).” [Zhang] Zhong-Jing originally wanted to elucidate the feature of clinical presentation and etiology for shang han syndrome and zhong feng syndrome in tai yang disease by comparing “緩脉 huán mài (a moderate pulse)” with “緊脉 jǐn mài (a tight pulse).” Any pulse that isnot tight can be called “緩脉 huán mài (a moderate pulse).In summary, the moderate pulse (緩脉 huán mài) in this line just implies that the force of the pulse felt is not as firm as the tight pulse is. Clinically, any pulse that is felt as neither tight nor firm can be considered a moderate pulse (緩脉 huán mài).</seg>

It is caused by wind-cold attack, in which wind is predominant. The character “證 zhèng (syndrome)” is added to the term “中風 zhòng fēng” as it is actually a syndrome of tai yang disease. The term “中風 zhòng fēng” in this line is a quite different wind-stroke, which is also called “中風 zhòng fēng” but it is a disease in zang-fu organ differentiation in other literature of Chinese medicine. That kind of zhong feng is caused by internal wind from stirring up from the liver due to either extreme heat or yin deficiency in the liver and kidney.</seg>

Likewise, the first line of other diseases in Discussion of Cold Damage, apart from yang ming disease, is called outline of such disease. Wu Qian and colleagues explicitly pointed out that “putting this line on the first one is to serve as the outline of tai yang disease. Whenever tai yang disease is discussed in the three sections of tai yang conformation, all refers to symptoms, signs and the pulse in this line.”</seg>

Ke Qin, a physician and well-known commentator for Discussion of Cold Damage in the seventeenth century, explained that “the floating pulse can be felt in all three yang diseases. Headache can present in all three yang diseases, so can aversion to cold. Only headache that is associated with stiffness on the nape exclusively belongs to tai yang disease.”</seg>

Fever will present soon afterward as long as wind-cold completely engages in the defensive qi and obstructs it. Fang You-Zhi offered an insightful explanation for the pathomechanism of fever due to attack of cold in this line. He wrote: Cold is a yin pathological factor that does not generate fever alone. When it invades yang channels of the body, however, it will become stagnated and fight with yang qi, which results in fighting and steaming of yang qi. Thus, fever ensues. Presentation of fever indicates that there is such stagnation, fighting and steaming for a while. And absence of fever indicates that there is no such stagnation, fighting and steaming at the very beginning.</seg>

Literally, vomiting and rebellion of qi, rather than vomiting only, should be the translation of this term in this line. In Chinese rhetoric, especially in the medical literature, the group of the characters “嘔逆 ǒu nì (vomiting and rebellion of qi)” belongs to one of rhetoric, which called “省略 shěng lüè (omit).” It means when two characters are present, one of them does not bear the meaning it usually has, though it is recorded.[[</seg>

Fang You-Zhi said that “yin refers to the position behind the middle position while yang to the position ahead of the middle position. A tight pulse appearing on all three positions is caused by the rigid attribution of cold.”</seg>

Literally, it should be translated as “a tranquil pulse” or “a calm pulse.” However, we have no such pulse recorded in the Chinese medicine literature and no such case has presented in clinical practice. According to the later content of this line, the changed pulse can refer to the rapid and urgent pulses (脉數急 mài shuò jí). From this point of view, this unchanged pulse means that the pulses are not rapid and urgent.“脉靜 mài jìng” is just a tool for Zhang Ji to explicate the pathology of a disease, and is a unique approach to pulse diagnosis performed by Zhang Ji. We will come across many terms to describe pulses, such as “脈和 mài hé (a harmony pulse),” “脈平 mài píng (a normal pulse)” and so on later in this book.</seg>

It does not mean that such progression must occur in those days. Date setting for both this line and the previous line might come from The Yellow Emperor's Inner Classic (黃帝內經 huáng dì nèi jīng). But Zhang Ji did not stick to dates set up by The Yellow Emperor's Inner Classic. In order to make a correct diagnosis for a disease, he exercised flexibility and attached great importance to clinical manifestations instead.</seg>

According to Wu Qian and colleagues, yang ming syndrome refers to aversion to heat rather than aversion to cold, feverish body, vexation, thirst and insomnia, and shao yang syndrome refers to alternating fever and chills, distention in the chest and hypochondriac region, nausea, bitter taste in the mouth and deafness.</seg>
                    <seg corresp="#CH1d0955_CHANT_005-3a.8" xml:lang="en" resp="#chris" modified="2020-12-09T09:44:59.672+09:00">1.Warm pathogen disease is considered to be one syndrome of tai yang disease according to the original text of Discussion of Cold Damage. In the original text, it is not clear what the cause of warm pathogen disease is. Thirst occurs at the very beginning of the disease and indicates that the body fluid is damaged, which implies that warm pathogen disease is caused by heat.</seg>

It is quite different from wind-warmth in the school of warm pathogen disease, which was developed by scholars and practitioners during the Ming and Qing Dynasties (1368--1911). According to Guohui Liu, wind-warm in warm pathogen disease is caused by an attack of the wind-heat pathogen during the spring or winter.[[</seg>

Clearly, the term “陰陽 yīn yáng” refers to the position of the pulse, which is the distal position (yang) and proximal position (yin), respectively, instead of the feeling of pulses with a light finger pressure (yang) and a heavy finger pressure (yin), because one cannot claim the feeling of a floating pulse with a heavy finger pressure.</seg>

In this line, it is caused by damage of both qi and body fluid due to improper sweating.</seg>

According to Origin of Chinese Characters (辭源 cí yúan), the character “溲 sōu” could have meant either urination or both urination and bowel movement at the time when Zhang Ji lived. Because abnormal urination, which includes incontinence of urination, was mentioned just prior to this term, it would be unlikely for Zhang Ji to say it again. Therefore, this term should be translated as “fecal incontinence” in this line. In Discussion of Cold Damage, when talking about the urination alone, Zhang Ji would likely have used the term “小便 xiǎo biàn” or the character “尿 niào,” when talking about bowel movement or stool, he would likely have used the terms “大便 dà biàn,” “便膿血 biàn nóng xuè,” “清膿血 qīng nóng xuè,” “利 lì” and “下利 xià lì.” Besides this line, line 110 also contains the character “溲 sōu,” which refers to both urination and bowel movement (see line 110 for further details).</seg>

In the context of this line, most ancient commentators and scholars ascribe the cause of yellow color appearing on the skin to heat.</seg>

According to Liu Du-Zhou and colleagues, some scholars believe this sentence can be understood as the description for symptoms and signs such as “looks like being fumed by fire” for the severe scenario in this line rather than wrong treatment. Both translations are reasonable.</seg>
