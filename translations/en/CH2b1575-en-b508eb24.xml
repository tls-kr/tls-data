Luji goes on to explain himself. "use of mind" would be an irrelevantly literal translation.</seg>

This is a dramatic way of talking, but perhaps not as provocatively informal as "let loose". *LJ 觀s the literature with empathy for the conditions of their production. *遣辭 "put forward/send forth into life formulations" conjoins a perhaps alternative way of looking at literary text. *The whole line is a temporal subordinate clause marked by the particle 其. *After 夫其 we have a QUADRISYLLABIC sequence.</seg>

ONE'S OWN object" must be read as a double reflexive "myself put together my own pieces". 其 understood. *屬 is unpretentious "put together" as opposed to 作 "create" or even 撰 "compose".</seg>

The 序 is clearly done post festum, as Knechtges has it. 文賦 is not necessarily used here as the title of the work: "a poetic exposition on the matter of literary works". *述 Having spoken of himself creating 作 a moment ago, LJ hastens to add politely the more modest 述 "transmit" in his 竊－self-effacing mode. He indicates that he is essentially merely "transmitting" features of his predecessors.  *先士 "predecessors", not "writers" must be compared with 先君 "former ruler".</seg>

Note that LJ's 文 does not distinguish prose from poetry. *作文 is an original nominalisation "the creating of literary works".  *利害 "what is helpful and harmful to the process of 作文. Neither  (ultimate) success nor failure come into the picture at this point. *所由 "the sources of (what is conducive and harmful to literary production)."</seg>

LJ assumes the reader is aware that he is using a literary work to deal with literature, on which theme there is this 典故 from the Book of Odes. The subject is the poet, "As it gets to the point where I hew an axe-handle, axe in hand." The statement is NOT a generalisation inserted here.</seg>

REPETITIO</seg>

The subject is LJ. *區 "realm, region" is abstract and refers to the (central) reference point of the poetic vision, not of things.　*以 "so as to (be able to)" focusses on what the position central point from which things are viewed allows LJ, (or perhaps after all the poet in general?), to do. *玄 "mysteriously&gt;with a focus on mysterious underlying realities" specifies the mystifying nature of the poetically analytic vision. *覽 "look over" is not optical but poetico-aesthetic. *What is dark are not physical objects, but the focus of the perspective.</seg>

The seasons/times as such are not poetically moving.</seg>
