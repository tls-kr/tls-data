A fuller report of this encounter occurs in Mencius 3B7:Gongsun Chou asked Mencius, “What is the meaning of the fact that you do not go and seek interviews with the various feudal lords?”      Mencius replied, “In ancient times, if one was not in service as a minister to a state, one did not seek an interview with its lord. Duangan Mu climbed over a wall to avoid such an interview; Xie Liu bolted his door and would not open it. But this is taking things too far. If pressed by one of the feudal lords, one may have an interview with him. Yang Huo wanted Confucius to come and see him, but did not want others to think that he had no sense of ritual propriety (li ). When “a minister gives a gift to a scholar-apprentice (shi ), but the scholar-apprentice is not at home to personally receive it, it is incumbent upon him to go to the minister’s home to pay his respects and express his gratitude. Yang Huo waited until Confucius was out, and then presented a steamed suckling pig at his home; Confucius waited until Yang Huo was out, and then went to pay his respects at the minister’s residence. One might ask: On this occasion, since Yang Huo had in fact first paid his respects to Confucius, how could Confucius have refused to go and see him? Master Zeng said, ‘It is harder to cringe and smile obsequiously than it is to irrigate the garden in the heat of summer.’ Zilu said, ‘To have to speak with someone you do not want to, and further, to have to take on a humble look in his presence—I would find such conduct unthinkable.’ From such reports we can see how exemplary persons (junzi ) cultivate their character.”           The point here is twofold. First exemplary persons do not put themselves in situations where protocol requires them to defer to people they do not respect. Secondly one does not speak on the responsibilities of others.See also The Zuo Commentary” “to the Spring and Autumn Annals Ding 8 and 9 (Legge V:765ff).】</seg>

While passing through the state of Zheng, Yinduan went to Feilin (“Yew Woods”) to requite them with gifts. He followed the etiquette proper to inviting his guests, and used the appropriate language for requiting gifts. Wenzi entered the capital to pay Wey’s respects. Ziyu served as go-between, Feng Jianzi and Zitai Shu welcomed the guests. When the official visit was finished and Wenzi took his leave, he said to the Marquis of Wey, “Zheng observes ritual propriety (li ). This will be her good fortune for several generations, and indeed will keep larger states from encroaching. The Book of Songs says,When the weather is hot　　Who can go without bathing?”　“Observing ritual propriety is to governing what bathing is to hot weather. With bathing saving one from the heat, what is there to worry about?”In his administration of the government, Zichan selected the able and employed them. Feng Jianzi was able to be decisive on important matters; Zitai Shu (Shi Shu) was an outstanding talent and a man of letters; Gongsun Hui (Ziyu) was able to understand the workings of the neighboring states, to distinguish rank, nobility, and talent in the clans and houses of their ministers, and further, he was good at drafting official proclamations; Pi Chen was an able advisor, although those plans laid in the countryside were successful while those laid in the cities were not.When his state of Zheng was going to have dealings with the other various lords, Zichan would ask Gongsun Hui about the workings of the neighboring states, and moreover, would get him to prepare some draft proclamations. With Pi Chen he would drive out into the countryside and seek his advice on what should be done, and reporting all of this to Feng Jianzi, he would get him to make the final decision. With affairs thus in order, he　“would turn them over to Zitai Shu for implementation in coordination with his official guests. It was for this reason that Zheng rarely failed in its diplomacy, and Beigong Wenzi was to say of Zheng that it observes ritual propriety.”</seg>

Confucius fasted for three days, and then petitioned three times that Qi be attacked. The duke replied to him, “It is long since that Lu has been weakened by Qi, so if we were to attack them, what do you think would happen?”“Chen Heng has assassinated his ruler,” responded Confucius, “and half of the people of Qi are disaffected. With the Lu forces augmenting this half of the Qi population, Lu can take the victory.”“You go and report this to the Ji Sun clan,” said the duke.

Confucius said to him, “I have studied the use of ritual vessels, but I have never heard anything about arms.” He withdrew, and “ordered his carriage harnessed for his departure, saying, “The bird chooses a tree to roost; since when can the tree choose the bird?”Wenzi hurriedly detained him, saying, “I was not asking your advice for my own sake, but to prevent the troubles that are befalling our state of Wey.” Confucius was going to stay, but when an envoy from Lu came with a ceremonial monetary gift to summon him, he returned home.</seg>
