Zilu appears to Confucius dressed in what the Master deems to be a pretentiousmanner, and is therefore scolded. After hurrying out to change into more humbleclothing, Zilu reappears and is lectured to by the Master:“Remark well what I am about to tell you. One who is not careful about9 his words becomespompous, and one who is not careful about his behavior becomes a show-off. One who putson the appearance of knowledge and ability is a petty person. Therefore, when the gentlemanknows something, he says, ‘I know it,’ and when he doesn’t know something, he says, ‘Ido not know it.’ This is the essence of speech. When the gentleman is able to do something,he says, ‘I am able to do it,’ and when he is not able to do something, he says, ‘I am not ableto do it.’ This is the perfection of behavior.”10We also read in the Xunzi the helpful comment, “Knowing when it is appropriate tospeak is wisdom; knowing when it is appropriate to remain silent is also wisdom.”11]</seg>
