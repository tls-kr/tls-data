They are totally missing in theDaozang redaction, but Lau adds them in the later position following the Northern Song redaction. Wefollow the Liu Ji redaction and its descendants in placing them here, at the beginning of a new sectionon the Way. This is also where Kusuyama places them (Enanji, 66). The textual evidence is equivocal,and we place these lines here because this location seems to better fit the flow of the argument.]</seg>
