[Footnote 131:“The Chinese text here is extremely terse and oddly worded, making it difficult to understand. Many commentators want to emend it to make it more sensible. The translation here is my own attempt to make sense of it as it stands. The point, as I understand it, is that when, for example, one is treated well or badly by others, this is (usually) a reaction to one’s previous conduct (see 1.57–60), but people mistakenly take this treatment simply as an incitement to which they must react, and the text is warning against that mistake.”</seg>
