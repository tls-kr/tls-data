As Zhu Xi explains, the general point of this passage is that we find out what the nature of a thing is by following how it develops in an unforced way from its original state. Thus, water reveals its nature when it flows downward unimpeded, not when we force it uphill (6A2). And if we are genuinely wise, we will take advantage of the nature of things in interacting with them (just as Yu did in his flood control projects. For a challenging alternative interpretation, see Graham, “The Background of the Mencian Theory of Human Nature.”]</seg>

Zhu Xi suggests that the difference in phrasing is because in the earlier passage Mengzi is stressing the need to cultivate these reactions, whereas here he is emphasizing the fact that they are innate. “Reflection” is focusing one’s attention upon and thinking about one’s feelings and the situations that elicit them. It is an activity that involves feelings,thoughts, and perception. Thus, Mengzi helped King Xuan to reflect upon his decision to spare an ox (1A7.4–9), he encouraged Yi Zhi to reflect upon the lavish burial he had given his own parents (3A5), and he assisted Wan Zhang in reflecting upon the stories of sage Shun (5A2).(Cf. 4A1.5, 4B20.5, 6A15, and Analects 2.15, 15.31, 19.6, and see the Introduction, “Mengzi’s Philosophy.”)]</seg>

Kongzi’s disciple Zengzi suggests that it is one of the two most important aspects of the Confucian Way (4.15).2 Zhu Xi thinks verses 7A4.2 and 3 describe two different states of ethical development: “If one turns toward oneself and is Genuine, one is already benevolent. But if one is not Genuine,there are still selfish thoughts interfering, and the Pattern is not pure.Hence, in all activities one should force oneself to extend (one’s sympathies)to others. When one is close to the general Pattern, benevolence is not far away.”]</seg>

It suggests thatthe heart (the seat of our “feelings”) is a manifestation of our nature,which is implanted in us by Heaven (cf. 6A6). Heaven is also responsiblefor fate (2B13, 5A6.2, 7A2). This suggests a relationship between three distinct entities, but Cheng Yi said, “The heart, the nature, and Heaven are all the one Pattern. However, if one discusses it from the perspective of the Pattern, one calls it ‘Heaven.’ If one discusses it from theperspective of the endowment that we receive, one calls it our ‘nature.’If one discusses it from the perspective of what is preserved in a person, one calls it the ‘heart.’” Similarly, Zhang Zai wrote, “Arising from the Great Vacuity, there comes the name ‘Heaven.’ Arising from the transformation of the qi, there comes the name ‘Way.’ From the harmony of the Vacuity and the qi comes the name ‘nature.’ From the harmony of the nature and awareness comes the name ‘heart.’” The School of the Way interpretation is thus a sort of moderate monism.]</seg>

(1) Many agree with Jiao Xun, who takes it to be another way of saying that “in human nature there is originally no righteousness.” 2 In contrast, righteousness would be internal if it were part of human nature. (2) Kwong-loi Shun argues that for righteousness to be external is for one’s knowledge of righteousness to derive from certain features of the external world. In contrast, righteousness would be internal if one’s knowledge of it comes from certain featuresof one’s “heart” or “mind.” 3 (3) I agree with Zhu Xi, who says “righteousness is external” means that one need not act out of any particular emotion in order to act righteously. In contrast, to say that righteousness is internal means that “in treating people as elderly, the feeling of genuine respect manifests itself from within, and one makes it fully genuine by respecting them.”4 (Cf. 6A5.2.) On Jiao Xun’s reading, the external/internal debate is over human nature; on Shun’s reading it is about ethical epistemology; and on Zhu Xi’s reading it is about motivation.]</seg>

The term “nature” emphasizes what we must actively cultivate. Our sensual desires and our virtuous inclinations are both inevitable aspects of who we are. However, people do not need to emphasize the cultivation of their sensual desires; they are essentially automatic (6A15). In contrast,people should think of their virtuous inclinations as something that needs cultivation, rather than as simply something one must accept with resignation.9]</seg>

(This would be a case of “discretion,” as {106} discussed in 4A17.) As an illustration, Zhao Qi refers to Analects 13.18 in which Kongzi endorses a son covering up his father’s crime to protect him.2 In contrast, Zhu Xi holds that great people are always faithful and resolute, but this is not because they aim to be. He reads the passage in the light of Analects 4.10 and approvingly quotes Yin Tun: “If one is focused upon righteousness, then faithfulness and being resolute are in its midst.

[Zhu Xi explains this difficult passage as follows: “Gaozi said that if there is something that one does not understand in doctrines, then one should set the doctrine aside and need not examine and search for the Pattern in one’s heart. If one is not at peace in one’s heart,then one should regulate one’s {38} heart with force and need not further seek for help from the qi. This is the way in which he firmly maintained his heart and quickly became unperturbed. Having recited Gaozi’s doctrines,Mengzi passes judgment on them: When Gaozi says that what you do not get from your heart you should not seek for in the qi, this is being concerned about the root and relaxed about the branches—that is acceptable. When he says that what you do not get from doctrines you shouldnot seek from the heart, then he is already lost due to external things, and so has left behind what is internal.This is necessarily unacceptable.”David S. Nivison offered an alternative interpretation,based on a parallel between this passage and Zhuangzi’s fictional dialogue between “Kongzi” and “Yan Hui”:Gaozi recommends that we completely commit ourselves to following correct ethical doctrines, forcing our heart and our qi to follow what they dictate. In contrast, Mengzi recommends that we not only follow ethical doctrines bu tseek further to find the basis for these doctrines in the reactions of our heart (2A6, 6A10), which will then guide our qi. Finally, Zhuangzi recommends that we ultimately eschew doctrines, empty our hearts, and follow the promptings of the qi, which unites us with other things.5]</seg>

By ‘cultivating theqi,’ one has the wherewithal to harmonize with the Way and righteousness and to not be in fear about any situation in the world. This is the manner in which he can assume agreat responsibility yet have an unperturbed heart. Gaozi’s learning is the exact opposite of this. His unperturbed heart is nothing more than being ignorantly unaware andstubbornly unmindful.” (See 2A2.17 for more on “understanding doctrines.”)]</seg>

If one examines oneself and is constantly{40} upright, one will be ashamed of nothing, and this qi will naturally be produced from within. One cannot do only a single action that accidentally accords with righteousness and then get it by a ‘seizure’ of what is external. ‘If some of one’s actions leave one’s heart unsatisfied, it will starve’ means that as soon as what one does is not in accord with righteousness and one examines oneself and is not upright, then there will be an inadequacy in one’s heart, and one’s body will not befilled. This being the case, how could righteousness bee xternal? Gaozi did not understand the Pattern of this, sohe said, ‘Benevolence is internal,’ ‘righteousness is external’ (6A4–5), and because he did not regard becoming righteous as a task, he was necessarily unable to accumulate righteousness in order to produce the floodlike qi. The earlier verse, ‘What you do not get from doctrines, do not seek for in your heart’ (2A2.9a), is precisely the meaning of treating righteousness as external.”]</seg>

Those who pull on them and ‘help’ them to grow assume they have it, and when they do not get it,they act recklessly. If one does not weed, then one will only fail to nurture it, but if one pulls on it, then one will,on the contrary, harm it. If one avoids these two things,then one’s qi will be nurtured and will not be injured. If like Gaozi one is unable to {41} accumulate righteousness but desires to force one’s heart to be regulated, then one will be unable to avoid the twin faults of assuming and assisting. Not only will he not be good at cultivating the‘floodlike,’ but he will even harm it.”Iris Murdoch makes a similar point: “Self-knowledge will lead us to avoid occasions of temptation rather than to rely on naked strength to overcome them. We must not arrogate to ourselves actions which belong to those whose spiritual vision is higher or other than ours. From this attempt, only disaster will come.” In short, “One must perform the lower act which one can manage and sustain: not the higher act that one bungles.”6]</seg>

Graham explains, in Mengzi’s era, qi“is like such words in other cultures as Greek pneuma ‘wind, air, breath.’ It is the energetic fluid which vitalises the body, in particular as the breath, and which circulates outside us as the air.” Later, this concept is “adapted to cosmology as the universal fluid … out of which all things condense and into which they dissolve.”3 (This late sense is how thinkers like Zhu Xi understood it.) Qi is thus the physical medium through which one’s emotions and personal character are manifested. So to “preserve one’s qi” is to control one’s emotions. Meng Shishe was similar to Zengzi in that both focused on something inside themselves, as opposed to Bogong You and Zixia, who focused on something external to themselves. However, as Zhu Xi explains, “what Meng Shishe preserved was just the qi of one’s self. This is not as good as Zengzi’s examining himself and following the Pattern (of the Way).He preserved what is especially important. Mengzi’s unperturbed heart has its source in this.”4]</seg>
