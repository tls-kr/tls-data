It suggests thatthe heart (the seat of our “feelings”) is a manifestation of our nature,which is implanted in us by Heaven (cf. 6A6). Heaven is also responsiblefor fate (2B13, 5A6.2, 7A2). This suggests a relationship between three distinct entities, but Cheng Yi said, “The heart, the nature, and Heaven are all the one Pattern. However, if one discusses it from the perspective of the Pattern, one calls it ‘Heaven.’ If one discusses it from theperspective of the endowment that we receive, one calls it our ‘nature.’If one discusses it from the perspective of what is preserved in a person, one calls it the ‘heart.’” Similarly, Zhang Zai wrote, “Arising from the Great Vacuity, there comes the name ‘Heaven.’ Arising from the transformation of the qi, there comes the name ‘Way.’ From the harmony of the Vacuity and the qi comes the name ‘nature.’ From the harmony of the nature and awareness comes the name ‘heart.’” The School of the Way interpretation is thus a sort of moderate monism.]</seg><seg corresp="#KR1h0001_tls_011-31a.2" xml:lang="en" resp="#CH" modified="2024-02-12T23:44:55.253+09:00">Mengzi

(1) Many agree with Jiao Xun, who takes it to be another way of saying that “in human nature there is originally no righteousness.” 2 In contrast, righteousness would be internal if it were part of human nature. (2) Kwong-loi Shun argues that for righteousness to be external is for one’s knowledge of righteousness to derive from certain features of the external world. In contrast, righteousness would be internal if one’s knowledge of it comes from certain featuresof one’s “heart” or “mind.” 3 (3) I agree with Zhu Xi, who says “righteousness is external” means that one need not act out of any particular emotion in order to act righteously. In contrast, to say that righteousness is internal means that “in treating people as elderly, the feeling of genuine respect manifests itself from within, and one makes it fully genuine by respecting them.”4 (Cf. 6A5.2.) On Jiao Xun’s reading, the external/internal debate is over human nature; on Shun’s reading it is about ethical epistemology; and on Zhu Xi’s reading it is about motivation.]</seg><seg corresp="#KR1h0001_tls_011-12a.2" xml:lang="en" resp="#CH" modified="2024-02-15T01:31:40.63+09:00">Mengzi asked,</seg><seg corresp="#KR1h0001_tls_011-13a.1" xml:lang="en" resp="#CH" modified="2024-02-27T18:51:44.33+09:00">“Why do you say that benevolence is internal and righteousness is external?”</seg><seg corresp="#KR1h0001_tls_011-13a.2" xml:lang="en" resp="#CH" modified="2024-02-15T01:32:06.129+09:00">Gaozi said,</seg><seg corresp="#KR1h0001_tls_011-13a.3" xml:lang="en" resp="#CH" modified="2024-02-15T01:32:16.918+09:00">“They are elderly, and we treat them as elderly.</seg><seg corresp="#KR1h0001_tls_011-13a.4" xml:lang="en" resp="#CH" modified="2024-02-27T18:51:51.475+09:00">It is not that they are elderly because of us.</seg><seg corresp="#KR1h0001_tls_011-13a.5" xml:lang="en" resp="#CH" modified="2024-02-15T01:32:45.723+09:00">Similarly, that is white, and we treatit as white,</seg><seg corresp="#KR1h0001_tls_011-13a.6" xml:lang="en" resp="#CH" modified="2024-02-15T01:33:00.452+09:00"> according to its being white externally to us.</seg><seg corresp="#KR1h0001_tls_011-14a.1" xml:lang="en" resp="#CH" modified="2024-02-27T18:52:54.549+09:00">Hence, I say it is external.” [If we want to ride a white horse, the fact that we choose“Silver” from our stable rather than “Chestnut” depends only upon the whiteness of the former horse, something external to us.

The term “nature” emphasizes what we must actively cultivate. Our sensual desires and our virtuous inclinations are both inevitable aspects of who we are. However, people do not need to emphasize the cultivation of their sensual desires; they are essentially automatic (6A15). In contrast,people should think of their virtuous inclinations as something that needs cultivation, rather than as simply something one must accept with resignation.9]</seg><seg

[Zhu Xi explains this difficult passage as follows: “Gaozi said that if there is something that one does not understand in doctrines, then one should set the doctrine aside and need not examine and search for the Pattern in one’s heart. If one is not at peace in one’s heart,then one should regulate one’s {38} heart with force and need not further seek for help from the qi. This is the way in which he firmly maintained his heart and quickly became unperturbed. Having recited Gaozi’s doctrines,Mengzi passes judgment on them: When Gaozi says that what you do not get from your heart you should not seek for in the qi, this is being concerned about the root and relaxed about the branches—that is acceptable. When he says that what you do not get from doctrines you shouldnot seek from the heart, then he is already lost due to external things, and so has left behind what is internal.This is necessarily unacceptable.”David S. Nivison offered an alternative interpretation,based on a parallel between this passage and Zhuangzi’s fictional dialogue between “Kongzi” and “Yan Hui”:Gaozi recommends that we completely commit ourselves to following correct ethical doctrines, forcing our heart and our qi to follow what they dictate. In contrast, Mengzi recommends that we not only follow ethical doctrines bu tseek further to find the basis for these doctrines in the reactions of our heart (2A6, 6A10), which will then guide our qi. Finally, Zhuangzi recommends that we ultimately eschew doctrines, empty our hearts, and follow the promptings of the qi, which unites us with other things.5]</seg><seg corresp="#KR1h0001_tls_003-14a.13" xml:lang="en" resp="#CH" modified="2024-03-12T04:34:42.184+09:00">[2.9b] “Your will is the commander of the qi.</seg><seg corresp="#KR1h0001_tls_003-14a.14" xml:lang="en" resp="#CH" modified="2024-03-12T04:35:11.352+09:00">Qi fills thebody.</seg><seg corresp="#KR1h0001_tls_003-14a.15" xml:lang="en" resp="#CH" modified="2024-03-12T04:35:32.36+09:00">When your will is fixed somewhere,</seg><seg corresp="#KR1h0001_tls_003-14a.16" xml:lang="en" resp="#CH" modified="2024-03-12T04:36:10+09:00">the qi sets up campthere.</seg><seg corresp="#KR1h0001_tls_003-14a.17" xml:lang="en" resp="#CH" modified="2024-03-12T04:38:10.922+09:00">Hence, it is said,</seg><seg corresp="#KR1h0001_tls_003-14a.18" xml:lang="en" resp="#CH" modified="2024-03-12T04:38:27.806+09:00">‘Maintain your will.</seg><seg corresp="#KR1h0001_tls_003-15a.1" xml:lang="en" resp="#CH" modified="2024-03-12T19:59:42.935+09:00">Do not injure the qi.’” [The “will” is simply the heart when it is focused on some goal.]</seg><seg corresp="#KR1h0001_tls_003-15a.2" xml:lang="en" resp="#CH" modified="2024-03-12T19:59:54.314+09:00">[2.10] Gongsun Chou continued, “Since you have already said, ‘When your will is fixed somewhere,</seg><seg corresp="#KR1h0001_tls_003-15a.3" xml:lang="en" resp="#CH" modified="2024-03-12T20:00:00.772+09:00">the qi sets up camp there,’</seg><seg corresp="#KR1h0001_tls_003-15a.4" xml:lang="en" resp="#CH" modified="2024-03-12T04:39:35.276+09:00">why do you add,</seg><seg corresp="#KR1h0001_tls_003-15a.5" xml:lang="en" resp="#CH" modified="2024-03-12T04:39:47.411+09:00">‘Maintain your will.</seg><seg corresp="#KR1h0001_tls_003-15a.6" xml:lang="en" resp="#CH" modified="2024-03-15T01:03:46.08+09:00">Do not injure the qi’?”</seg><seg corresp="#KR1h0001_tls_003-16a.1" xml:lang="en" resp="#CH" modified="2024-03-12T04:42:12.839+09:00"/><seg corresp="#KR1h0001_tls_003-16a.3" xml:lang="en" resp="#CH" modified="2024-03-12T04:42:40.833+09:00">“When your will is unified, it moves the qi.</seg><seg corresp="#KR1h0001_tls_003-16a.2" xml:lang="en" resp="#CH" modified="2024-03-12T04:42:31.361+09:00">Mengzi replied,</seg><seg corresp="#KR1h0001_tls_003-16a.4" xml:lang="en" resp="#CH" modified="2024-03-12T04:42:49.494+09:00">When the qi is unified, it moves your will.</seg><seg corresp="#KR1h0001_tls_003-16a.5" xml:lang="en" resp="#CH" modified="2024-03-12T20:00:10.887+09:00">Now, running and stumbling</seg><seg corresp="#KR1h0001_tls_003-16a.6" xml:lang="en" resp="#CH" modified="2024-03-12T04:43:18.557+09:00">have to do with the qi,</seg><seg corresp="#KR1h0001_tls_003-17a.1" xml:lang="en" resp="#CH" modified="2024-03-12T20:39:03.584+09:00">but nonetheless they perturb one’s heart.” [Zhu Xi comments, “Mengzi explains that if the direction of the will is unified, the qi will definitely follow it.

This being the case, how could righteousness bee xternal? Gaozi did not understand the Pattern of this, sohe said, ‘Benevolence is internal,’ ‘righteousness is external’ (6A4–5), and because he did not regard becoming righteous as a task, he was necessarily unable to accumulate righteousness in order to produce the floodlike qi.

From this attempt, only disaster will come.” In short, “One must perform the lower act which one can manage and sustain: not the higher act that one bungles.”6]</seg><seg corresp="#KR1h0001_tls_003-22a.1" xml:lang="en" resp="#CH" modified="2024-03-16T06:41:08.708+09:00">[2.17] Gongsun Chou next asked, “What do you mean by ‘understanding doctrines’?”</seg><seg corresp="#KR1h0001_tls_003-22a.2" xml:lang="en" resp="#CH" modified="2024-03-12T05:25:28.23+09:00">Mengzi replied,</seg><seg corresp="#KR1h0001_tls_003-22a.3" xml:lang="en" resp="#CH" modified="2024-03-12T21:12:04.99+09:00">“If someone’s expressions are one-sided, I know that by which they are obscured.</seg><seg corresp="#KR1h0001_tls_003-22a.4" xml:lang="en" resp="#CH" modified="2024-03-12T18:14:11.3+09:00">If someone’s expressions are excessive, I know what they have sunk into.</seg><seg corresp="#KR1h0001_tls_003-22a.5" xml:lang="en" resp="#CH" modified="2024-03-12T21:05:43.796+09:00">If someone’s expressions are heretical, I know that by which they are separated from the Way.</seg><seg corresp="#KR1h0001_tls_003-22a.6" xml:lang="en" resp="#CH" modified="2024-03-12T21:11:43.288+09:00"> If someone’s expressions are evasive, I know that by which they are overwhelmed.</seg><seg corresp="#KR1h0001_tls_003-22a.7" xml:lang="en" resp="#CH" modified="2024-03-12T21:05:54.639+09:00">When these faults grow in the heart,</seg><seg corresp="#KR1h0001_tls_003-22a.8" xml:lang="en" resp="#CH" modified="2024-03-12T05:27:36.166+09:00">they are harmful in governing.</seg><seg corresp="#KR1h0001_tls_003-22a.9" xml:lang="en" resp="#CH" modified="2024-03-12T05:28:14.567+09:00">When they are manifested in governing,</seg><seg corresp="#KR1h0001_tls_003-22a.10" xml:lang="en" resp="#CH" modified="2024-03-12T21:12:04.109+09:00">they are harmful in one’s activities.</seg><seg corresp="#KR1h0001_tls_003-22a.11" xml:lang="en" resp="#CH" modified="2024-03-12T05:28:43.924+09:00">When sages arise again,</seg><seg corresp="#KR1h0001_tls_003-23a.1" xml:lang="en" resp="#CH" modified="2024-03-12T18:15:59.7+09:00">they will surelyfollow what I have said.” [Zhu Xi comments, “Gaozi did notunderstand doctrines, yet he was unwilling to seek for it inhis heart.

C. Graham explains, in Mengzi’s era, qi“is like such words in other cultures as Greek pneuma ‘wind, air, breath.’ It is the energetic fluid which vitalises the body, in particular as the breath, and which circulates outside us as the air.” Later, this concept is “adapted to cosmology as the universal fluid … out of which all things condense and into which they dissolve.”3 (This late sense is how thinkers like Zhu Xi understood it.) Qi is thus the physical medium through which one’s emotions and personal character are manifested. So to “preserve one’s qi” is to control one’s emotions. Meng Shishe was similar to Zengzi in that both focused on something inside themselves, as opposed to Bogong You and Zixia, who focused on something external to themselves. However, as Zhu Xi explains, “what Meng Shishe preserved was just the qi of one’s self. This is not as good as Zengzi’s examining himself and following the Pattern (of the Way).He preserved what is especially important. Mengzi’s unperturbed heart has its source in this.”4]</seg><seg corresp="#KR1h0001_tls_003-20a.20" xml:lang="en" resp="#CH" modified="2024-03-12T21:13:39.855+09:00">如果聖人重現世間,也一定認同我這話。”公孫丑説:“宰我、子貢善於講話,冉牛、閔子、顔淵善於闡述德行,孔子兼而有之,但他依然説:‘我對於辭令,太不擅長。’〔而您既説話得體,又善於養浩然之氣,言語道德兼而有之,〕那麽,您已經是位聖人了嗎?”孟子説:“哎呀! 這叫什麽話! 從前子貢問孔子説:‘老師已經進入“聖”的境界了嗎?’孔子説:‘超凡入聖,我做不到;我不過學習不知滿足,教人不知疲倦罷了。’子貢便説:‘學習不知滿足,這是智;教人不知疲倦,這是仁。仁而且智,老師已經進入“聖”的境界了。’聖人,孔子都不自居,〔你卻説我是,〕這叫什麽話呢!”</seg></p></div></body></text></TEI>
