All except Hermann; And Hermann is a German.How rare, how almost non-existent a quality uprightness must be, Confucius bitterly says, if even into the legend of the most upright of all men there has crept an instance of falsity!　Translators have supposed Wei-shéng Kao to have been some actual contemporary of Confucius, whose conduct the Master was criticizing.This misses the whole point.】</seg>
