Although the Sage does not care that men are imperiled,  【“The Sage” is the standard English translation of the phrase 聖人 sheng ren. However, in Chinese philosophy the Sage is not merely a wise man, but the wise founder and ruler of a political unit -- usually an empire or kingdom, though in the Daodejing it seems to be a stateless utopia. It’s a contested term, and the Daoist Sage is different than a Confucian or other Sage. (The American Sages would be the Founding Fathers, perhaps including Lincoln, FDR, or even Ronald Reagan).】</seg>

In chapter 60 of Laozi it is said that when the Empire follows Dao the spirits 鬼神 do not harm men, nor does the Sage harm men; in Laozi 81, it is said that the Way of Heaven benefits and does not harm. In the Nei Ye chapter of Guanzi (thought to be from the same tradition as Laozi; p. 75, Roth) it is said that the sage is not harmed by men nor vulnerable to others’ harm; sageliness is identified with the vital essence 精, which is manifested in the world as the spirits, and in men as sageliness. (As it happens, buhai 不害 “does not harm” is Shen Buhai’s given name.)These assurances suggest that the Sage historically traces back to intimidating shaman-like figures who were in communication with the unseen world and possessed of spiritual powers, and who were thus capable either of benefit or of harm, though the Daoist sage is purely benevolent.

Pi Kan and Wu Tzu-hsu were ministers famous for their rectitude; both served evil emperors and were executed when they tried to remonstrate these emperors about their failings.Thompson has difficulty with this passage, and my translation is somewhat conjectural. Originally tao 謟 here was written dao 道, and I have accepted Kuo Jingfan’s suggestion (cited but rejected by Thompson) that the latter was just a phonetic substitution for the former, which I inserted into the text. I get about the same interpretation of the passage as Thompson, but without his far-fetched reading of the word dao 道 (dissertation, p. 531).Shen Dao’s overall argument is that when a state cannot fall into chaos or be saved from chaos merely by the corruption or dedication of single individuals, whether princes or ministers. A well-ordered state does not rely on single individuals but has disciplinary structures in place which maintain its order. Heroic individuals cannot save a poorly-ordered state, and corrupt individuals cannot destroy a well-ordered state. In the process of making this point he exaggerates somewhat, since an all-powerful sovereign can destroy these disciplinary structures. But he’s arguing that the fall of Xia cannot be assumed to have been simply the consequence of Jie’s evil, and that Jie might have inherited and already-disordered state.】</seg>

If loyalty fills the world, harm comes to the state. 忠 is usually translated “loyalty” and I have followed the custom. That is often but not always its meaning (see Goldin, 2008). In many contexts it means something like “conscientiousness” or “diligence” or “attentiveness”. In my opinion the best single translation might be “dedication / dedicated”, which overlaps with conscientiousness and loyalty. The general point being made is not dependent on the translation: The problem with loyalty / diligence is that it cannot save a badly-ordered state, so that if such a state relies on loyal or heroically diligent ministers to save it, it will fail. (Laozi 18:When the state has fallen into confusion and disorder, then there are loyal ministers.)A well-run state does not need to rely on exceptional efforts: if ordinary men correctly do their assigned tasks, that will be enough. And if a state does rely on heroic effort, that is a sign that it is in trouble.】</seg>
