Although the Sage does not care that men are imperiled,  【“The Sage” is the standard English translation of the phrase 聖人 sheng ren. However, in Chinese philosophy the Sage is not merely a wise man, but the wise founder and ruler of a political unit -- usually an empire or kingdom, though in the Daodejing it seems to be a stateless utopia. It’s a contested term, and the Daoist Sage is different than a Confucian or other Sage. (The American Sages would be the Founding Fathers, perhaps including Lincoln, FDR, or even Ronald Reagan).】</seg>

In chapter 60 of Laozi it is said that when the Empire follows Dao the spirits 鬼神 do not harm men, nor does the Sage harm men; in Laozi 81, it is said that the Way of Heaven benefits and does not harm. In the Nei Ye chapter of Guanzi (thought to be from the same tradition as Laozi; p. 75, Roth) it is said that the sage is not harmed by men nor vulnerable to others’ harm; sageliness is identified with the vital essence 精, which is manifested in the world as the spirits, and in men as sageliness. (As it happens, buhai 不害 “does not harm” is Shen Buhai’s given name.)These assurances suggest that the Sage historically traces back to intimidating shaman-like figures who were in communication with the unseen world and possessed of spiritual powers, and who were thus capable either of benefit or of harm, though the Daoist sage is purely benevolent.
