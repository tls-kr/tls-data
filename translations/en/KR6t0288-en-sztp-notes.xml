               <seg corresp="#KR6t0288_HZ_01-02.p1.s1" ana="@1-17-2">[@1-17-2]: At times when all the myriad dharmas are not self (manbō tomo ni ware ni arazaru jisetsu 萬法ともにわれにあ らざる時節): Probably to be taken in the sense, “when everything is seen to be empty of independent existence.”</seg>
               <seg corresp="#KR6t0288_HZ_01-03.p1.s1" ana="@1-17-3">[@1-17-3]: Because, from the start,the way of the buddhas has jumped out from abundance and scarcity (butsudō motoyori hōken yori chōshutsu seru yue ni 佛道もとより豊倹より跳出せるゆえに): Presumably, meaning that the way of the buddhas transcends the affirmation and negation of the previous two sentences.</seg>
               <seg corresp="#KR6t0288_HZ_01-03.p1.s1" ana="@1-17-4">[@1-17-4]: “flowers falling when we cherish them, weeds growing when we despise them” (hana wa aijaku ni chiri, kusa wa kiken ni ouru花は愛惜にちり、草は棄嫌におふる): A Japanese reworking of a saying attributed to Chan Master Jing of Niutou 牛頭精禪師 (dates unknown) (see Tiansheng guangdeng lu 天聖廣燈錄, ZZ.135:860b6-7):問、如何是和尚家風。師云、華從愛惜落、草逐棄嫌生。Someone asked, “What is the Reverend’s house style?” The Master said, “Flowers fall from my love for them; weeds grow from my hatred of them.” Dōgen also quotes this line in his Eihei kōroku 永平廣錄 (DZZ.3:36, no. 51).</seg>
               <seg corresp="#KR6t0288_HZ_01-04.p1.s1" ana="@1-18-5">[@1-18-5]: the myriad dharmas proceeding to practice and verify the self (manbō susumite jiko o shushō suru萬法すすみ て自己を修證する): This phrase could also be read “to practice and verify the self while the myriad dharmas advance.”</seg>
               <seg corresp="#KR6t0288_HZ_01-05.p1.s1" ana="@1-18-6">[@1-18-6]: further deluded within their delusion (meichū u mei迷中又迷): An expression in Chinese that occurs several times in the Shōbōgenzō; perhaps reflecting the Dahui Pujue chanshi yulu 大慧普覺禪師語錄 at T.1998A.47:893a21.</seg>
               <seg corresp="#KR6t0288_HZ_01-06.p1.s1" ana="@1-18-7">[@1-18-7]: they are verified buddhas (shōbutsunari 證佛なり): Or “they verify buddhahood”; an expression occurring several times in the Shōbōgenzō, usually as a verb-object compound.</seg>
               <seg corresp="#KR6t0288_HZ_01-07.p1.s1" ana="@1-18-8">[@1-18-8]: We take up body and mind and see forms (shinjin o ko shite shiki o kenshu shi 身心を擧して色を見取し): Most interpreters take this phrase to mean, “we (or perhaps the buddhas) see with the entire body and mind.” Hence, they read the passage as describing a non-dualistic apprehension in which there is no opposition between the object and its reflection in the mirror or the water. It is also possible, however, to take the phrase to mean simply, “we see using the body and mind,” and to understand the passage as describing ordinary, biased perception, in contrast to the undistorted reflection of the mirror or the water. See Supplementary Notes, s.v. “Body and mind.”when one side is verified, the other side is obscure (ippō o shō suru toki wa ippō wa kurashi 一方を證するときは 一方はくらし): Perhaps to be taken as a description of a non-dualistic perception, in which the object (moon) and the subject (water) are both complete in themselves.</seg>
               <seg corresp="#KR6t0288_HZ_01-08.p1.s1" ana="@1-19-9">[@1-19-9]: the traces of awakening that are ended are brought out for a long, long time (kyūkatsu naru goshaku o chōchō shutsu narashimu休歇なる悟迹を長長出ならしむ): A difficult passage typically taken to mean that the traces of having ended the traces of awakening continue forever. In his use here of the unusual expression chōchō shutsu 長長 出, Dōgen may have had in mind the saying by Changsha Jingcen 長沙景岑 (dates unknown), alluded to in Shōbōgenzō kenbutsu 正法眼藏見佛, that “You can’t get out [the eye of the śramaṇa] for a long, long time” (chōchō shutsu futoku 長長出不得); see Supplementary Notes, s.v. “All the worlds in the ten directions are the single eye of the śramaṇa.”</seg>
               <seg corresp="#KR6t0288_HZ_01-09.p1.s1" ana="@1-19-10">[@1-19-10]: person of the original lot (honbun nin 本分人): An expression, occurring several times in Chan literature, for one who has realized his or her true nature, or fundamental lot in life. The translation of this sentence seeks to preserve the syntactical parallel with the preceding sentence, such that “the dharma” (hō法) is read as the grammatical subject of both verbs here. Perhaps more naturally, we may read, “When the dharma has been transmitted to one, one is immediately the ‘person of the original lot.’”</seg>
               <seg corresp="#KR6t0288_HZ_01-10.p1.s1" ana="@1-19-11">[@1-19-11]: If we become intimate with our conduct and return here (moshi anri o shitashiku shite kori ni ki sureba もし行 李をしたしくして箇裡に歸すれば): I.e., when we attend closely to our actions in the place where we are.</seg>
               <seg corresp="#KR6t0288_HZ_01-11.p1.s1" ana="@1-19-12">[@1-19-12]: firewood occupies the dharma position of firewood (takigi wa takigi no hōi ni jū shite 薪は薪の法位に住して): Drawing on the common Buddhist teaching that each dharma exists in its own moment, or temporal position, without changing into something else. Allusion to a passage in the Lotus Sūtra that can be read “The dharmas abide in their dharma positions.” See Supplementary Notes, s.v. “Dharmas abide in their dharma positions.”</seg>
               <seg corresp="#KR6t0288_HZ_01-11.p1.s1" ana="@1-20-13">[@1-20-13]: before and after are cut off (zengo saidan 前後際斷): A common idiom, found in the prajñā-pāramitā literature; see Supplementary Notes, s.v. “Before and after cut off.”</seg>
               <seg corresp="#KR6t0288_HZ_01-11.p1.s1" ana="@1-20-14">[@1-20-14]: “not arising” (fushō不生); “not ceasing” (fumetsu 不滅): A standard pair in many Mahāyāna texts expressing the doctrine that all dharmas are empty and, hence, neither arise nor cease. Dōgen here is conflating “arising and ceasing” (shōmetsu 生滅) with “life and death” (shōji 生死). an established buddha-turning of the dharma wheel (hōrin no sadamareru butten 法輪のさだまれる佛轉): A play with the standard phrase, the “buddha turns the dharma wheel” (butten hōrin 佛轉法輪).</seg>
               <seg corresp="#KR6t0288_HZ_01-12.p1.s1" ana="@1-20-15">[@1-20-15]: The depth must be a measure of the height (fukaki koto wa, takaki bunryō naru beshi ふかきことは、たかき分 量なるべし): Likely meaning that the depth of one’s awakening is a function of the loftiness of the dharma that inspired it.</seg>
               <seg corresp="#KR6t0288_HZ_01-12.p1.s1" ana="@1-20-16">[@1-20-16]: The length of time (jisetsu no chōtan 時節の長短): Likely the time of (or until) awakening.</seg>
               <seg corresp="#KR6t0288_HZ_01-13.p1.s1" ana="@1-21-17">[@1-21-17]: virtues of the ocean (kaitoku 海德): Buddhist texts sometimes attribute eight virtues to the ocean: that it is vast and deep; that its tides are regular; that it does not retain corpses; that it contains precious substances; that it collects the five rivers; that it absorbs precipitation without increase or decrease; that it contains great fish; and that it is a single saltiness throughout. (See, e.g., Fo shuo hai ba de jing 佛説海八德經, T.35.1:819a19-b7.)</seg>
               <seg corresp="#KR6t0288_HZ_01-13.p1.s1" ana="@1-21-18">[@1-21-18]: It is like a palace; it is like a jeweled necklace (gūden no gotoshi, yōraku no gotoshi 宮殿のごとし、瓔珞のごと し): Likely reflecting the Buddhist teaching, found especially in Yogācāra literature, known as “the four views of water” (issui shiken 一水四見): devas see water as jewels (or jeweled ground), humans as water, pretas(“hungry ghosts”) as pus and blood, fish as a dwelling.</seg>
               <seg corresp="#KR6t0288_HZ_01-13.p1.s1" ana="@1-21-19">[@1-21-19]: Amidst the dust and beyond its bounds (jinchū kakugai 塵中格外): Perhaps to be taken as the mundane world of the six sense objects (or “dusts”) and the higher realm of the buddha dharma. See Supplementary Notes, s.v. “Dust.”only what is reached by the strength of the eye of study (sangaku gan riki no oyobu bakari 參學眼力のおよぶばか り): I.e., only those objects that the vision gained through our practice is capable of perceiving. The expression “eye of study” (sangaku gen參學眼) occurs with some frequency in the Shōbōgenzō.</seg>
               <seg corresp="#KR6t0288_HZ_01-13.p1.s1" ana="@1-21-20">[@1-21-20]: house styles of the myriad dharmas (manbō no kafū萬法の家風): The expression “house style” (kafū家風) usually refers to the teaching styles of the various “houses,” or lineages, of Zen. Dōgen may be using it here simply as a playful way of saying “what things are like,” but it is possible that the “dharmas” here are not only the “things” of this world, but also the myriad “teachings” of the various schools of Buddhism. the square and the round (hōen 方圓): These terms, while here of course reflecting Dōgen’s point that the ocean is neither square nor round, are also used as Buddhist technical terms for “partial” and “complete” teachings respectively — i.e., teachings that utilize expedient devices (hōben方便; S. upāya) and teachings that directly reveal the highest truth.</seg>
               <seg corresp="#KR6t0288_HZ_01-13.p1.s1" ana="@1-21-21">[@1-21-21]: it is not that this is so only beside us (katawara nomi kaku no gotoku aru ni arazu かたはらのみかくのごとくあ るにあらず): The term katawaraかたはら (literally, one’s “side”) may be taken to mean one’s “surroundings” — as opposed to the following jikige 直下 (“right here”), meaning “at our very feet” or, perhaps, “we ourselves.”</seg>
               <seg corresp="#KR6t0288_HZ_01-14.p1.s1" ana="@1-22-22">[@1-22-22]: from long ago (mukashi yori むかしより): Probably best taken in the sense “from the start” (moto yoriもとより).</seg>
               <seg corresp="#KR6t0288_HZ_01-14.p1.s1" ana="@1-22-23">[@1-22-23]: when their function is great (yōdai no toki 用大のとき): “Great function” (daiyū大用; also read daiyō) is a common term in Zen literature for the activities of the awakened master; see Supplementary Notes, s.v. “Manifestation of the great function.”</seg>
               <seg corresp="#KR6t0288_HZ_01-14.p1.s1" ana="@1-22-24">[@1-22-24]: none of them fails to reach its limits, and nowhere do they fail to overturn it (zuzu ni henzai o tsukusazu to iu koto naku, shosho ni tōhon sezu to iu koto nashi頭頭に邊際をつくさずといふことなく、處處に踏飜せずといふこと なし): A loose translation of a passage more literally read, “for each of them, there is no case in which it fails to exhaust the boundaries; in each place, there is no case in which they fail to kick over.” The verb tōhon踏飜, rendered here as “overturn” (as in tipping over a boat), is used in Chan texts to express the “great function” — as in phrases like “kick over the great oceans, jump over Mount Sumeru” (tōhon daikai tekitō shumi踏翻大海趯倒須彌).</seg>
               <seg corresp="#KR6t0288_HZ_01-14.p1.s1" ana="@1-22-25">[@1-22-25]: We should know that they take water as life (i sui i myō shirinu beshi以水爲命しりぬべし): The saying that fish (and dragons) “take water as life” occurs in several Chan sources. The grammatical subject of the verb “should know” (shirinu beshi しりぬべし) here is unexpressed and could also be taken as “they” (i.e., “the fish must have known”), a reading suggesting that Dōgen was recalling a line by Hongzhi Zhengjue 宏智正覺 (1091-1157) (Hongzhi chanshi guanglu宏智禪師廣錄, T.2001.48:25c23): 龍魚未知水爲命。 Dragons and fish don’t know that water is life.</seg>
               <seg corresp="#KR6t0288_HZ_01-14.p1.s1" ana="@1-22-26">[@1-22-26]: there should be further steps forward (sara ni shinpo aru beshi さらに進歩あるべし): I.e., there must be other permutations of the phrase; see Supplementary Notes, s.v. “Stepping forward and stepping back.”</seg>
               <seg corresp="#KR6t0288_HZ_01-14.p1.s1" ana="@1-22-27">[@1-22-27]: That there are practice and verification, and that they have those with lifespans, those with lives, are like this (shushō ari, sono jusha myōsha aru koto, kaku no gotoshi 修證あり、その壽者命者あること、かくのごとし): I.e., Buddhist practice and verification are to living beings as water is to fish or the sky is to birds.</seg>
               <seg corresp="#KR6t0288_HZ_01-15.p1.s1" ana="@1-23-28">[@1-23-28]: When we get this place, our actions accordingly realize the kōan (kono tokoro o ureba, kono anri shitagaite genjō kōan su このところをうれば、この行李したがひて現成公案す): “Realize the kōan” renders Dōgen’s novel verbal form genjō kōan su 現成公案す, which might be understood, “manifests, or expresses, ‘the realized kōan.’”</seg>
               <seg corresp="#KR6t0288_HZ_01-15.p1.s1" ana="@1-23-29">[@1-23-29]: This way and this place (kono michi kono tokoro このみちこのところ): “This place” could also be read in apposition to “this way”: “this way, this place.” they exist like this (kaku no gotoku aru nari かくのごとくあるなり): The sense of “like this” is unclear; perhaps, “in a way that enables them to be the loci for the expression of the realized kōan.”</seg>
               <seg corresp="#KR6t0288_HZ_01-15.p1.s1" ana="@1-23-30">[@1-23-30]: To get one dharma is to penetrate one dharma; to meet one practice is to cultivate one practice (toku ippō tsū ippō nari, gū ichigyō shu ichigyō nari 得一法通一法なり、遇一行修一行なり): Dōgen gives these two phrases in Chinese, as if quoting some text; but there is no known source. “Dharma” here likely refers to “teaching”: one thoroughly understands each Buddhist teaching one learns.</seg>
               <seg corresp="#KR6t0288_HZ_01-15.p1.s1" ana="@1-23-31">[@1-23-31]: the fact that the known limits are not conspicuous is so because this knowing is born together with and studies together with the exhaustive investigation of the buddha dharma (shiraruru kiwa no shirukarazaru wa, kono shiru koto no, buppō no gūjin to dōshō shi dōsan suru ga yue ni, shika aru nari しらるるきはのしるからざる は、このしることの、佛法の究盡と同生し同參するがゆえに、しかあるなり): Perhaps meaning something like, “the limits of this place and this way are not obvious to the practitioner because they are experienced as the practice itself.” Dōgen often uses the expressions dōshō同生 (“arises together” or “lives together”) and dōsan 同參 (“studies together”) to express identity or equivalence.</seg>
               <seg corresp="#KR6t0288_HZ_01-16.p1.s1" ana="@1-23-32">[@1-23-32]: finding one’s place (tokusho 得處): Taken here as the Chinese version of Dōgen’s earlier Japanese tokoro o uru ところをうる, though it could as well be read as “what one gets.”</seg>
               <seg corresp="#KR6t0288_HZ_01-16.p1.s1" ana="@1-23-33">[@1-23-33]: what is intimately ours is not necessarily realized (mitsu’u kanarazushimo genjō ni arazu 密有かならずしも見 成にあらず): “What is intimately ours” (or, perhaps, “private being”) renders mitsu’u 密有, a term not found elsewhere in the Shōbōgenzō and not common in the Buddhist literature; typically taken as a reference to our innermost reality. what is realized is, “why necessarily so?” (genjō kore ka hitsu nari 見成これ何必なり): “Why necessarily so?” (ka hitsu 何必) is a fixed expression in Chinese used to question (or challenge) a statement; perhaps meaning here that what is realized in “ultimate verification” is not a previously unrealized reality but a questioning of previous understanding. * * * * *</seg>
               <seg corresp="#KR6t0288_HZ_01-17.p1.s1" ana="@1-24-34">[@1-24-34]: Chan Master Baoche of Mount Mayu (Mayokuzan Hōtetsu zenji麻浴山寶徹禪師): Dates unknown; a follower of Mazu Daoyi 馬祖道一 (709-788). Mount Mayu 麻浴山 is in present-day Shanxi province. Dōgen here recounts, largely in Japanese, a conversation found, e.g., at Zongmen tongyao ji宗門統要集, ZTS.1:54d4-7); and shinji Shōbōgenzō眞字正法眼藏 (DZZ.5:194, case 123).</seg>

The phrase reflects an expression used in reference to the powers of the advanced bodhisattva, “to churn the Long River into butter and turn the whole earth into gold” (kaku Chōga i soraku, hen daichi i ōgon 攪長河爲酥酪、變大地爲黃金).</seg>
               <seg corresp="#KR6t0288_HZ_02-01.p1.s1" ana="@1-28-1">[@1-28-1]: “When Bodhisattva Avalokiteśvara practiced the deep prajñā-pāramitā” (Kanjizai bosatsu no gyō jin hannya haramitta ji 觀自在菩薩の行深般若波羅蜜多時): The opening paragraph here is devoted to comments on the Heart Sūtra (Bore boluomiduo xin jing 般若波羅蜜多心經). This first sentence represents Dōgen’s variation, in mixed Chinese and Japanese, on the first sentence of the Sūtra (T.251.8:848c6-7): 觀自在菩薩行深般若波羅蜜多時、照見五蘊皆空。 When Bodhisattva Avalokiteśvara practiced the deep prajñā-pāramitā, he perceived that the five aggregates were all empty. See Supplementary Notes, s.v. “Four elements and five aggregates.”</seg>

Cf. the Heart Sūtra here (Bore boluomiduo xin jing 般若波羅蜜多心經, T.251.8:848c10): 是故空中、無色、無受想行識。 Therefore, in emptiness, there is no form, no sensation, perception, formations or consciousness.</seg>

The antecedent of “this” (kono この) here is uncertain. Perhaps, the phrase is to be understood simply as, “in explaining its teaching on wisdom, it is said [in the Sūtra].” “form is itself emptiness; emptiness is itself form” (shiki soku ze kū nari, kū soku ze shiki nari 色即是空なり、空 即是色なり): Quoting from the famous passage in the Heart Sūtra; see Supplementary Notes, s.v. “Form is itself emptiness; emptiness is itself form.”</seg>

This and the preceding sentence reflect the Heart Sūtra (Bore boluomiduo xin jing 般若波羅蜜多心經) at T.251.8:848c10-12: 無眼耳鼻舌身意。無色聲香味觸法。無眼界。乃至無意識界。 There is no eye, ear, nose, tongue, body or mind.

In a Buddhist context, the term translated as “observe” (kan 觀; “to see,” “regard,” “contemplate,” etc.) often (though not always) indicates a contemplative practice. The expression jisetsu innen 時節 因緣, translated here as “the conditions of the time,” typically in the sense “the actual circumstances of the particular occasion,” occurs often in Chan texts.

Dōgen doubtless has in mind here the standard Buddhist list of powers given above, Note 62. In his “Shōbōgenzō jinzū”正法眼藏神通 (DZZ.1:394), Dōgen identifies this list with what he calls there the “small spiritual powers” discussed in the traditional Buddhist texts, in contrast to the “great spiritual powers” discussed in Chan texts: 二乘外道經師論師等は、小神通をならふ、大神通をならはず。諸佛は大神通を住特す、大神通を相傳す、これ佛神 通なり. . . . また五通六通みな小神通なり。 The two vehicles, the other paths, the sūtra masters and treatise masters, and the like, learn the small spiritual powers; they do not learn the great spiritual powers. The buddhas maintain the great spiritual powers; they transmit the great spiritual powers. These are the spiritual powers of a buddha. . . . Further, the five powers or six powers are all small spiritual powers. “three three in front, three three in back” (zen sansan go sansan 前三三後三三): Or, perhaps, “three and three of the former, three and three of the latter.” Dōgen is clearly playing here with the number six, but the exact sense of this Zen expression is uncertain. The source appears in several Chan collections as well as in Dōgen’s shinji Shōbōgenzō眞字正法眼藏(DZZ.5:194-195, case 127); see Supplementary Notes, s.v. “Three three in front, three three in back.”the pāramitāof the six spiritual powers (roku jinzū haramitsu 六神通波羅蜜): Or “the six spiritual power pāramitās.” I.e., the perfection of the six paranormal powers, or the paranormal powers as the six perfections of the bodhisattva.

The expression keige suru mono 罣礙するもの, translated here as “obstructions,” should probably be taken as something like “that which identifies with,” in keeping with Dōgen’s recurrent use of the passive form keige seraru in the sense “to be identified with” (given the active mood of the predicate, the particle niに is taken here as a locative, rather than an instrumental).

I beg the Reverend in his compassion briefly to explain it for me.” The Ancestor said, “‘Impermanence’ means buddha nature. ‘Permanence’ means the mind that discriminates all the dharmas good and bad.” [Xing Chang] said, “The Reverend’s explanation is very different from the text of the sūtra.” The Ancestor said, “I transmit the buddha mind seal. How could it differ from the sūtras of the buddhas?”</seg>

Here, there seems to be the additional sense that buddha nature itself is a demonic (i.e., anti-Buddhist) notion smuggled into the Buddhist concept of “all living beings.” The translation ignores Dōgen’s playful use of the numeric classifier ichimai 一枚, used for flat objects, in the expression masu ichimai 魔子一枚 (literally, “one sheet of Māra son”).</seg>

The word zenten 全天 (“the whole of heaven”) is less common and does not appear elsewhere in the Shōbōgenzō; taken here to mean “all of heaven” or “all the heavens.” Afterwards, he had no words (gotō mi u go 後頭未有語): No doubt an allusion to Huangbo’s “desisting”; likely reflecting another remark by Huangbo that occurs in the Tiansheng guangdeng lu 天聖廣燈錄 soon after the passage Dōgen has been examining here. Note that, in this passage (ZZ.135:659a6-13), Huangbo is also seen “desisting,” as well as using the expression, akin to that in our text, “patch-robed monk of true colors.” 一日五人新到、同時相看。四人禮拜。一人不禮拜、以手畫一圓相而立。師云、還知道好隻獵犬麼。云尋羚羊氣來。 師云、羚什無氣、汝向什麼處尋。云尋羚羊蹤。來師云、羚羊無蹤。汝向什麼處尋。云與麼則死羚羊也。師便休。來 曰昇座退、問昨日尋羚羊僧出來。其僧便出。師云、老僧昨日後頭未有語在。作麼生。其僧無語。師云、將謂本色衲 僧、元來是義學沙門。One day, five people newly arrived came to see [Huangbo] together. Four of them bowed. One did not bow but drew a circle with his hand and stood there. The Master said, “Do you know a good hunting dog?” The monk said, “He seeks the antelope’s scent.” The Master said, “If the antelope has no scent, where does he seek it?” The monk said, “He seeks the antelope’s tracks.” The Master said, “If the antelope has no track, where does he seek it?” He said, “That’s a dead antelope.” The Master desisted. The next day, as he was retiring from his lecture, he called out the monk he had asked about seeking the antelope. The monk came out. The Master said, “Since yesterday, this old monk has had no words. How about it?” The monk had no words. The Master said, “He was supposed to be a patch-robed monk of true colors, but from the beginning he was a “śramaṇa who studies doctrine.”</seg>

Shigong always kept his bow drawn and an arrow set, waiting for a student. When the Master [Yizhong] approached the dharma seat, Gong said, “See the arrow.” The Master exposed his breast and said, “That’s an arrow that kills people. How about the arrow that revives people?” Gong twanged his bow string three times. The Master bowed. Gong said, “For thirty years, a single bow with a pair of arrows. I only hit half a sage.” Then, he broke his bow and arrow. Some versions of the Jingde chuandeng lu record a simpler variant. 師乃披襟當之。石鞏曰、三十年張弓架箭。只射得半箇漢。The Master exposed his breast as a target. Shigong said, “For thirty years, I drew my bow and set an arrow. I only hit half a man.”</seg>

The Sanskrit original of Zhiyi’s third term here is uncertain: some scholars have suggested vṛddha (“expanded,” “developed”), while others take yilituo 矣栗馱 simply as an alternative transliteration of hṛdaya, here treated as a separate Sanskrit term.

The antecedents of the two pronouns “this” (kore) are not clear. Somewhat as in English, the “eye” (ganzei 眼睛) typically indicates (a) what is essential or central, and (b) (spiritual) vision, or insight; hence, to “ball up as (or in) one’s eye” suggests to “see as something really is.” See Supplementary Notes, s.v. “Eye.” To “play with karmic consciousness” (rō gosshiki 弄業識) is a common expression in Zen literature for being caught up in ordinary, deluded thoughts; some readers follow that negative sense here, but others see our sentence as a playful affirmation of karmic consciousness. See Supplementary Notes, s.v. “Karmic consciousness.”“Two or three bushels” (nisan koku 二三斛) renders the dry measure koku 斛, typically figured at five pecks (to 斗); “a thousand or ten thousand lengths” (senman tan 千萬端) refers to tan 端, a measurement for bolts of cloth, the exact dimensions varying in different periods.

Dōgen’s version here (repeated in “Shōbōgenzō hotsu bodai shin” 正法眼藏發菩提心) does not seem to correspond exactly to any extant text; more common versions give “believing that one’s home is not a home, abandons home and leaves home” (shin ke hi ke shake shukke 信家非家捨家出家) or “believing that one’s home is not a home, leaves home and studies the way” (shin ke hi ke shukke gakudō信家非家出家學道).

The first element, biso鼻祖, is a common term denoting “founder” or “the first person to do something.” Literally translated, it means “ancestor from the nose,” thought to reflect an early Chinese belief that the nose is the first part of a creature to take shape in the womb. Bimatsu鼻末 (literally, “the tip of the nose”) does not occur by itself but only in combination with biso. ascending or descending (kōjō kōge 向上向下): A term also meaning simply “above and below” but used, as perhaps here, to indicate the two phases of the bodhisattva path: “ascending” toward one’s own liberation, and “descending” into the world for the sake of sentient beings.</seg>

To play with the shadow to work on the shape is not to recognize that the shape is the basis of the shadow. To raise one’s voice to stop the echo is not to realize that the voice is the root of the echo. To eliminate the afflictions to hurry to nirvāṇa is like getting rid of the shape and looking for its shadow. To separate from living beings and seek the fruit of buddhahood is like silencing the voice and seeking its echo.

See Supplementary Notes, s.v. “Skin, flesh, bones, and marrow.” The term danchō斷腸, translated literally here as “cutting one’s guts,” has the common meaning, “to be in great pain.” As others have suggested, it may be that it should be replaced here by the more common danpi 斷臂 (“cutting the arm”), in reference to the famous legend that Huike cut off his arm in order to become Bodhidharma’s disciple.

How we are to understand this list is uncertain.

The odd expression “eye obstruction” (genge 眼礙) may here be echoing the preceding use of “obstruction” (keige 罣礙) in the sense of “identity” — i.e., “the eye as it is.” At the same time, the diction is reminiscent of a saying of Fayan Wenyi 法眼文益 (885-958) recorded in the shinji Shōbōgenzō眞字正法眼藏 (DZZ.5:186, case 111); see Supplementary Notes, s.v. “Obstructed by the eye.” The expression “perfectly clear, the tips of the hundred grasses,” which appears elsewhere in the Shōbōgenzō, is usually associated with a story of the Layman Pang Yun 龐蘊居士 (740?-808) that Dōgen records in his shinji Shōbōgenzō眞字正法眼藏 (DZZ.5:168, case 88); see Supplementary Notes. “not seeing a single dharma,” “not seeing a single thing” (fuken ippō, fuken ichimotsu 不見一法、不見一物): The former phrase is best known from the Zhengdao ge證道歌 (T.2014.48:396c11-12): 不見一法即如來。 Not seeing a single dharma — this is a tathāgata. The latter phrase occurs with some frequency, as, e.g., in the Shaoshi liumen 少室六門 (T.2009.4:370b26-27): 不見一物、名爲見道。不行一物、名爲行道。 Not seeing a single thing is called seeing the way; not practicing a single thing is called practicing the way. it is “if it arrives” in this dharma; it is “if it arrives” in that dharma (shahō ni nyaku shi nari, nahō ni nyaku shi nari 這法に若至なり、那法に若至なり): The odd “if it arrives” (nyaku shi 若至) can probably be understood here simply as “it arrives.” What it is that arrives and what it means to arrive are subject to interpretation. One reading might take “the perfect clarity of the hundred grasses” as the subject: i.e., such clarity (or, perhaps, the “obstructed” vision that perceives it) “arrives” (is present) in every phenomenon (dharma). Alternatively, given the allusion in the preceding sentence to the saying, “Not seeing a single dharma — this is a tathāgata,” the sense may be that the practicing buddha arrives in every phenomenon (dharma). Such a reading might help to explain the use of problematic “if it arrives” (nyaku shi 若至) here, inspired by a saying quoted in the “Shōbōgenzō busshō”正法眼藏 佛性: 時節若至佛性現前。 If the time arrives, the buddha nature appears.</seg>

If not simply an error, perhaps the claim is only that Huizhong was an imperial teacher who lived during the reigns of four emperors.

The claim that the Emperor pulled Huizhong’s cart into the palace seems an improvement on the tradition that, in 761, Huizhong was invited to lecture at the imperial palace and so impressed the Emperor Suzong that the latter personally mounted Huizhong’s cart to see him off.

In his “Shōbōgenzō udonge”正法眼藏 優曇華 (DZZ.2:171), Dōgen gives a much more positive interpretation, as “just sitting, sloughing off body and mind” (shikan taza datsuraku shinjin 祇管打坐脱落身心); see Supplementary Notes, s.v. “Just sit” and “Body and mind sloughed off.”spring forth from this pivot (kono kanreisu o chōshutsu suru この關棙子を跳出する): See Supplementary Notes, s.v., “Pivot.” “To spring forth” (or “jump out”; chōshutsu 跳出) is one of Dōgen’s favorite expressions for “getting free from,” or “transcending.”</seg>

Despite Dōgen’s final remark here, the use of such a combination of cushion and mat does not seem to have been a universal practice.

The posture described here, with the left leg crossed over the right, is sometimes called the gōma降魔 (“demon quelling”) position; the opposite form, in which the right leg is crossed over the left (the so-called kichijō吉祥, or “auspicious” posture), is probably the more common in iconography and in many practice traditions. Though Dōgen’s style is sometimes considered standard for the Zen school, both forms can be found in the school’s literature. Similar disagreements over whether the left or the right should be on top can be found in descriptions of the semi-cross-legged posture and in the placement of the hands. In the Hōkyō ki寶慶記 (DZZ.7:42, number 36), Dōgen reports that his teacher, Tiantong Rujing 天童如淨, held that the position of the legs might be reversed if they become painful after long sitting. In his Fukan zazen gi 普勸坐禪儀 (DZZ.5:6), Dōgen follows the Zuochan yi坐禪儀 inrecommending at this point that the practitioner stretch the body up and swing it back and forth to the left and the right. Keizan’s Zazen yōjin ki坐禪用心記 (SSZ.Shūgen宗原 2:427a) explains that one should swing the body from side to side seven or eight times, gradually reducing the length of the arc, an exercise still widely followed in Sōtō practice.</seg>

Not only, he says, does the opening of the eyes ward off drowsiness, but it can serve to enhance the power of samādhi (Kagamishima, 279). Other Buddhist accounts of meditation, however, sometimes favor closing the eyes completely. In the Hōkyō ki寶慶記 (DZZ.7:42, number 36), Rujing 如淨 says that, while experienced meditators, not susceptible to drowsiness, may sit with eyes closed, beginners should keep them open.</seg>

In the realization of the kōan, from the beginning, the embodied buddha is not making a buddha. When “the nets and cages” are long broken, a seated buddha does not interfere with making a buddha. When we study with the body like this, “from a thousand ages, ten thousand ages past,” from eternity, we have the power to “enter into buddha and enter into Māra.” In stepping forward and stepping back, we display a light that “fills the ditches, fills the gullies.” How could this not be called our “face before our father and mother were born”?</seg>

The discussion of these marks draws on the famous teaching in the Diamond Sūtra (e.g., at Jingang bore boluomi jing 金剛般若波羅蜜經, T.235.8:750a20-23) that the true mark of a buddha is no mark, because he transcends all phenomenal characteristics.

Dōgen is here playing on the compound setsubutsu 殺佛, shifting its sense from a verb-object construction (“killing a buddha”) to an adjective-noun form (“a killing buddha”).

On this reading, the argument of this section might look something like the following: The “subtle knowing” of the buddhas clearly discriminates all phenomena (the “mountains and rivers”). We should not think that this (higher) “discriminatory thinking” is something for which we must wait; it has “already appeared” in each mind’s inherent power of discrimination (“every buddha who has previously discriminated”). Zhengjue’s “ever without [discriminatory thought]” here refers to this inherent power, which “appears” even in ordinary perception. The spiritual practice of one who understands this is free to travel Dongshan’s “path of the bird” (where “you don’t meet a single person”).</seg>

The Master rubbed his back and said, “A nice buddha hall, but the buddha isn’t sacred.” His teacher turned his head to look at him. The Master said, “The buddha may not be sacred, but it still emits a light.” The influential nineteenth-century Shōbōgenzō shōten zokuchō正法眼藏涉典續貂 (SCZ.5:317) records a variant version, closer to our text here, that may or may not have been known to Dōgen: 師乃撫背曰、好箇佛殿無佛。師囘首視之。師曰、雖無佛且能放光。 The Master rubbed his back and said, “A nice buddha hall with no buddha.” His teacher turned his head to look at him.

The tradition that Gautama left home at age nineteen and achieved awakening at age thirty is found in the Jingde chuandeng lu景 德傳燈錄, T.2076.51:205b12-24; the more common version of the Buddha’s life has him leaving his father’s palace at age twenty-nine and awakening under the bodhi treee at age thirty-five. In his “Shōbōgenzō sansui kyō” 正法眼藏山 水經 as well, Dōgen gives the Buddha’s period of training as twelve years, rather than the usual six. “attaining the way simultaneously with the whole earth and sentient beings” (daichi ujō dōji jōdō大地有情同時 成道): A reference to the Buddha’s awakening under the bodhi tree. The expression, which appears in several of Dōgen’s texts, is from a line that he cites in his “Shōbōgenzō hotsu bodai shin” 正法眼藏發菩提心 (DZZ.2:164; also quoted at Eihei kōroku永平廣錄 DZZ.3:28, no. 37): 釋迦牟尼佛言、明星出現時、我與大地有情、同時成道。 The Buddha Śākyamuni said, “When the dawn star appeared, I, together with the whole earth and sentient beings, simultaneously attained the way.” Although the passage appears in Chan texts from this period (see, e.g, Jianzhong jingguo xudeng lu 建中靖國續燈錄, ZZ.136:36b17-18), it has not been located in any extant sūtra. The translation here follows the usual reading of daichi ujō大地有情 as a compound subject; the phrase could also be read, “sentient beings of the whole earth.”</seg>

Dōgen is drawing here on a conversation he records in his shinji Shōbōgenzō眞字正法眼 藏 (DZZ.5:190, case 118), which begins with Weishan saying to Yangshan, 承聞子在百丈先師處、問一答十問十答百。 I hear that when you were at our former master Baizhang’s place, you had ten answers for one question and a hundred answers for ten questions. The conversation is found in the Liandeng huiyao聯燈會要 (ZZ.136:559a4-10) and elsewhere. Note that, if our date of 814 for Baizhang’s death is correct, Yangshan would have been only seven years old at the time. Yangshan’s biographies (e.g., at Jingde chuandeng lu 景德傳燈錄, T.2076.51:282a29-b1) have him entering the order at the age of seventeen. A well-known story about Weishan’s other famous disciple Xiangyan Zhixian 香嚴智閑 (e.g., at Dahui’s 大慧Zhengfayanzang 正法眼藏 (ZZ.118:72a5-9) also begins with the line: 山問、我聞汝在百丈先師處、問一答十問十答百。 [Wei]shan questioned him. “I hear that, when you were with our former master Baizhang, you gave ten answers for one question, a hundred answers for ten questions.” a Śāriputra, with “a hundred answers for ten questions” (mon jū tō hyaku no Shūshi 問十答百の鶖子): Though it does not occur elsewhere in the Shōbōgenzō, the expression, “a hundred answers for ten questions” is a common phrase in Chan literature for a smart student. Śāriputra was the disciple of Buddha Śākyamuni recognized for his mastery of doctrine. Although in the story of Weishan’s interview with Yangshan, the latter is not compared to Śāriputra, in another story recorded by Dōgen (see, e.g., shinji Shōbōgenzō眞字正法眼藏, DZZ.5:158, case 61), Weishan likens his two disciples, Yangshan and Xiangyan, to Śāriputra and Maudgalyāyana respectively. “three years tending the ox” (kan gyū sannen 看牛三年): Typically understood as a metaphor for spiritual training.

This section represents an extended exploration, difficult to capture in translation, of the two adverbial expressions in the quotation from the Lotus Sūtra: sōkei 相繼 (“in succession,” which, as here, Dōgen also uses as the verb sōkei su 相繼す, “to succeed [one another]”), and tenji 轉次 (translated, somewhat awkwardly, as “in turn, next,” which Dōgen will also treat as the verb tenji su 轉次す, “to do [or be] in turn”).</seg>

The verb toku 得 (“attain”) probably indicates identity: “turning” is just “turning”; “next” is just “next.”</seg>

The first in the series seems to refer to the coming of the buddhas from India to China. Supplementary Notes, s.v. “Coming from the west.”The apparent combination here of “five buddhas” (gobutsu 五佛), a teaching normally associated with esoteric Buddhism, with the “six ancestors” (rokuso 六祖) central to Zen tradition seems quite unlikely; probably, the phrase gobutsu rokuso should be taken as “five or six buddhas and ancestors” (goroku busso 五六佛祖). Still, which (if any) historical figures Dōgen might have had in mind here is unclear; and some MS witnesses replace the phrase with the more familiar soshi 祖師 (“Ancestral Master”) — i.e., the First Ancestor, Bodhidharma; see Supplementary Notes, s.v. “Intention of the Ancestral Master’s coming from the west.”</seg>

The expression “spiritual powers and wondrous functions” alludes to the paranormal attributes of a buddha; the saying also recalls a famous story in the Lotus Sūtra of the prior career of Buddha Śākyamuni, in which he “drew water and gathered firewood” (kyūsui shūshin 汲水拾薪) for his teacher, the future Devadatta (Miaofa lianhua jing妙法蓮華經, T.262.9:34c6).</seg>

In each of these phrases, Dōgen treats the feature of the buddha as a transitive verb having itself as object. “Marks and signs” translates sōgō相好, a reference to the thirty-two primary marks and eighty auspicious signs on the physical body of a buddha — a term highly improbable as a verb.</seg>

From a remark attributed to Dongshan Liangjie 洞山良价 (807-869), in answer to a question about the three bodies of a buddha. The Dongshan yulu 洞山語錄 (T.1986A.47:510b24-25) gives the question as: 問、三身之中、阿那身不墮衆數。 [A monk] asked, “Among the three bodies [of the buddha], which body doesn’t fall among the numbered?” Dōgen’s shinji Shōbōgenzō眞字正法眼藏(DZZ.5:152, case 55) has a variant version: 洞山因僧問、三身中那身説法。師曰、吾常於此切。僧後問曹山、洞山道吾常於此切、意旨云何。山云、要頭斫將去。 僧又問雪峰。峯以拄杖劈口打曰、我也曾到洞山來。Dongshan was asked by a monk, “Among the three bodies, which preaches the dharma?” The Master said, “I’m always close to this.” The monk later asked Caoshan [i.e., Caoshan Benzhi 曹山本寂 (840-901)], “Dongshan said, ‘I’m always close to this.’ What does that mean?” Shan said, “If you want my head, cut it off and take it.” The monk again asked Xuefeng [i.e., Xuefeng Yicun 雪峰義存 (822-908)]. Feng struck him in the mouth with his staff and said, “I’ve been to Dongshan.”</seg>

The soapberry seed is used for Buddhist prayer beads (juzu珠數); for uses of “eyes,” see Supplementary Notes, s.v. “Eye.” Dōgen has a very similar line in his “Shōbōgenzō jippō” 正法眼藏十方 (DZZ.2:95), probably after a saying of Chan Master Yunmen Wenyan 雲門 文偃 (Yunmen yulu雲門語錄 , T.1988.47:544a11-12): 若説佛説祖、佛意祖意大似將木槵子換却爾眼睛相似。 If we talk of the buddhas and talk of the ancestors, the intention of the buddhas and the intention of the ancestors resemble switching soapberry seeds for your eyes. he has had his nose switched by someone for a bamboo tube (bikū hi nin kankyaku chikutō ryō ya 鼻孔被人換却竹 筒了也): A tube made of bamboo used for inhaling medicinal vapors is one of the items permitted a monk. A similar juxtaposition of the soapberry seed and bamboo tube occurs in Dōgen’s Eihei kōroku 永平廣錄, DZZ.3:88, no. 143: 職由瞿曇眼睛在山僧手裏如木患子、山僧鼻孔在瞿曇手裏如竹筒兒。 Hence, Gautama’s eyes are in this mountain monk’s hand, like soapberry seeds; this mountain monk’s nose is in Gautama’s hand, like a bamboo tube.

The verb ten 轉 (“to turn”) can be taken in the sense “to teach” (as in ten hokke 轉法華, “to teach the Lotus”); but this phrase is often interpreted as the view that mind and its object “turn” and are “turned” by each other. Possibly reflecting a usage seen in a conversation of Changsha Jingcen長沙景岑 (dates unknown), recorded in Dōgen’s shinji Shōbōgenzō眞字正法眼藏 (DZZ.5: 132-133, case 16) and discussed in his “Shōbōgenzō keisei sanshoku”正法眼藏溪 聲山色: 因僧問、作麼生轉得山河大地歸自己去。師曰、作麼生轉得自己歸山河大地去。 A monk asked, “How does one turn the mountains, rivers, and the whole earth back to the self?” The Master said, “How does one turn the self back to the mountains, rivers, and the whole earth?” the great sages (daishō大聖): Or “the Great Sage.” An honorific used in reference to buddhas, bodhisattvas, and arhats; sometimes understood here as referring specifically to Buddha Śākyamuni. talking of the mind and talking of the nature (sesshin sesshō説心説性): An expression found frequently in Zen texts, perhaps best known from a saying of Dongshan Liangjie 洞山良价 (807-869): 裏面有人説心説性 Inside [this cloister], there’s someone talking of the mind and talking of the nature. In striking contrast to his remark here, in his “Shōbōgenzō sesshin sesshō”正法眼藏説心説性, Dōgen praises such talk as “the great origin of the way of the buddhas” and attacks the famous Chan master Dahui Zonggao 大慧宗杲 (1089- 1163) for being dismissive of it. seeing the mind and seeing the nature (kenshin kenshō見心見性): Not a common combination, though of course Zen tradition was famous for claiming that one could “see one’s nature and attain buddhahood” (kenshō jōbutsu見性 成佛), a saying attributed to no less than Bodhidharma himself; see Supplementary Notes, s.v. “Pointing directly at the person’s mind, seeing the nature and attaining buddhahood.” In his “Shōbōgenzō shizen biku”正法眼藏四禪比丘, however, Dōgen strongly criticizes this claim, saying, “Where among the seven buddhas and twenty-eight Indian ancestors does one find it said that the buddha dharma is just seeing the nature?” the livelihood of other paths (gedō no kakkei 外道の活計): I.e., the pursuit of non-Buddhist (S. tīrthika) religions.</seg>

The compound tōdatsu 透脱 regularly occurs in Dōgen’s writing as a transitive verb meaning “to pass beyond,” “to transcend,” etc.; here (and in section 33, below), it takes the particle ni に, presumably to be read as a locative marker. skin, flesh, bones, and marrow (hi niku kotsu zui皮肉骨髓): An expression, occurring very often throughout the Shōbōgenzō, indicating the essence or truth or entirety of something or someone.

The claim (repeated in “Shōbōgenzō kesa kudoku”正法眼藏袈裟功德) that the dragons are liberated from these torments by the kāṣāya doubtless reflects the tradition that a thread from the Tathāgata’s robe will protect dragons from the garuḍa (see, e.g., Sāgara-nāga-rāja-paripṛcchā-sūtra; Fo shuo hailongwang jing 佛説 海龍王經, T.598.15:151a6-16). The term ryūrin 龍鱗 (“dragon scales”) normally refers to the pattern of the dragon’s scales, rather than to the dragon itself; but elsewhere Dōgen uses it as synecdoche for “dragon,” by analogy with kinrin 金鱗 (“gold scales”) for “golden fish” (see Eihei kōroku永平廣錄, DZZ.3:86, no. 139): 清淨海中釣得龍鱗金鱗 In the clear ocean, we can catch a dragon and a golden fish.</seg>

The term kien 機緣, taken here to mean “karmic circumstances,” or “opportunity,” is interpreted by some readers as “records,” or “episodes.” There is a common trope in the early Buddhist literature that reads, 佛言、善來比丘、鬚髪自落、袈裟著身。 When the Buddha said, “Welcome, bhikṣu,” his beard and hair fell off by themselves, and a kāṣāya cloaked his body. In his “Shōbōgenzō senmen” 正法眼藏洗面 and “Shukke”出家 chapters, Dōgen cites this trope in the case of Mahākāśyapa (from Jingde chuandeng lu 景德傳燈錄, T.2076.51:206a2-3).</seg>

Though traditionally attributed to the semi-legendary sixth-century figure Fu Dashi 傅大師, or Great Master Fu (497-569), it is thought to have been composed in the Tang. The verse quoted by Linji here is commenting on the Diamond Sūtra’s famous discussion of the “marks” (xiang相; S. lakṣana) of a buddha. It is introduced in the original Fu Dashi text by two passages (T.2732.85:2b18-21) from Kumārajīva’s translation of the Diamond Sūtra (Jingang bore boluomi jing 金剛般若波羅 蜜經, T.235.8:750a20-23; T.235:8.749a23-25): 須菩提、於意云何、可以三十二相見如來不。不也世尊、不可以三十二相得見如來。何以故。如來説三十二相即是非 相。是名三十二相。 “Subhūti, what do you think? Can one see the Tathāgata by his thirty-two marks?” “No, World-Honored One, one cannot see the Tathāgata by his thirty-two marks. Why is this? The thirty-two marks spoken of by the Tathāgata are no-marks. These are called ‘the thirty-two marks.’” 佛告須菩提、凡所有相皆是虚妄。若見諸相非相、則見如來。 The Buddha admonished Subhūti, “Whatever marks there are, they are all vain delusion. If one sees the marks as no-marks, that is seeing the Tathāgata.” bodily marks (shinsō身相): I.e., the extraordinary physical “marks” (S. lakṣana) held to adorn the body of a buddha (and a cakravartin, or “wheel-turning” monarch).</seg>

So, I’ve never said anything.” The Master said, “It’s hard to reach such a field.” Yang said, “As far as I can see, I can’t say even a word.” The Master said, “You can’t do it even for someone.” Yang said, “From ancient times all the sages have been like this.” The Master said, “Many are the people who would laugh at you for such a reply.” Yang said, “To laugh at me is to practice with me.” The Master said, “What about putting yourself forward?” Yang circumambulated the [master’s] meditation seat, once around.

The English “show” here renders the Chinese si 示, which means both “to indicate” and “to instruct.” The question of what a master uses “to teach people” (shi ren 示人 ) is a common topic of conversation in Zen texts and occurs several times in Zhaozhou’s recorded sayings.

The phrase sakke shikitareru 作家しきたれる, translated here as “authored,” represents an unusual verbal form derived from the Chinese zuojia 作家, indicating an author or poet and, in Zen usage, an accomplished master.</seg>

Here, the question would seem to be asking about the true creater of “this one kōan,” or, more broadly, the true nature of Zhaozhou. This is the only occurrence of the term in the Shōbōgenzō; its use here may reflect Nanquan’s question, above, “Are you a śrāmaṇera with a master” (shu 主), as well as, more importantly, dialogues found in Zhaozhou’s recorded sayings, in which he is himself asked about “who is in charge” of him. See, e.g., Zhaozhou yulu 趙州語錄 (ZZ.118:308b5): 問、如何是趙州主人公。師云、田厙奴。 Someone asked, “Who’s in charge of Zhaozhou?” The Master answered, “A field hand.”</seg>

If I used an object to teach you, Acārya, it would bury the Acārya.” [The monk] said, “Then what about that?” The Master bid them farewell [and left]. If these passages are influencing Dōgen’s remarks here, his point might be, at least in part, that Zhaozhou’s cypress tree is not a memorial to Chan ancestor Bodhidharma but what he is using to “bury” (i.e., teach) people.</seg>

Their story, quoted here in Chinese, appears in Dōgen’s shinji Shōbōgenzō眞 字 正 法 眼 藏(DZZ.5:158, case 62), probably taken from the Zongmen tongyao ji宗門統要集 (ZTS.1:159b); see also Liandeng huiyao 聯燈會要 (ZZ.136:768b14-16). cloister beside [the road] (bō in傍院): Supplying ro路 from the Chinese versions of the story, which give lu bang yuan 路傍院. “Inside” (rimen 裏面): The element men 面, while here having little semantic function in the Chinese, has the etymological sense, “face” or “surface” — a sense Dōgen will take advantage of in his commentary below, section 18. “there’s someone” (unin 有人): Or simply “someone”; Dōgen will play with the predicate-nominative syntax of the Chinese idiom in his commentary, section 18. “talking of the mind and talking of the nature” (sesshin sesshō説心説性): A famous phrase that gets picked up in other Zen texts. “Mind” and “nature” can be understood either as two topics (the mind and its true nature) or as two elements of a single compound expression, shinshō心性, “the nature of the mind.” The predicate, setsu 説, taken here simply as “to talk about,” also has the meanings, “to explain,” “to expound,” “to teach,” “to preach.” Hence, especially in the setting of the cloister here, Dongshan’s remark could be read, “There’s someone preaching the mind and preaching the nature.”</seg>

Commentators often parse this term as “the Master’s (i.e., Dongshan’s) elder brother” and treat it as an honorific among Dongshan’s followers; this interpretation may work for Dōgen’s use in this line, but it hardly fits with Dongshan’s own use in the next line.</seg>

The expression, which appears in several of Dōgen’s texts, is from a line that he will quote in his “Shōbōgenzō hotsu bodai shin” 正法眼藏發菩提心 chapter (DZZ.2:164; also quoted at Eihei kōroku 永平廣錄, DZZ.3:28, no. 37): 釋迦牟尼佛言、明星出現時、我與大地有情、同時成道。 The Buddha Śākyamuni said, “When the dawn star appeared, I, together with the whole earth and sentient beings, simultaneously attained the way.” Although the passage appears in Chan texts from this period (see, e.g, Jianzhong jingguo xudeng lu 建中靖國續燈錄, ZZ.136:36b17-18), it has not been located in any extant sūtra. The translation here follows the usual reading of daichi ujō大地有情 as a compound subject; the phrase could also be read, “sentient beings of the whole earth.” “all living beings have no buddha nature” (issai shujō mu busshō一切衆生無佛性): A saying attributed to Weishan Lingyu 潙山靈祐 (771-853); see, e.g., shinji Shōbōgenzō眞字正法眼藏 (DZZ.5:188, case 115). Often interpreted to mean that the buddha nature is “empty” — i.e., not some thing that sentient beings have.

The translation here treats both elements as verbs, but interpretations of Dōgen’s use of shōkai regularly treat it as a subject-predicate compound, meaning one’s “verification accords” (often, with that of one’s master); the relationship could also be understood as a predicate-object, meaning that one “verifies the accord” (with the teachings or one’s master).

Mount Caoxi (Sōkeizan 曹溪山), in present-day Guangdong, is the site of his temple, the Baolinsi 寶林寺. The expression kobutsu古佛, literally “old (or ‘ancient’ or ‘past’) buddha,” is regularly used in reference to “the buddhas of the past,” especially the seven buddhas mentioned here; Zen texts also employ it as an honorific for past masters of the tradition — a use Dōgen will take quite literally below; see Supplementary Notes, s.v. “Old buddha.” Dōgen’s Japanese rendering of Huineng’s words here closely resembles a passage in the “Shōbōgenzō shisho”正 法眼藏嗣書, originally composed in 1241 and edited in 1243 (the date of our text). There is no known source for these words. The Dunhuang version of the Liuzu tan jing六祖壇經 (T.2007.48:344c11) does contain a statement by Huineng that he represents the fortieth generation in a line beginning with the seven buddhas; but this manuscript was of course not known to Dōgen, and other extant versions of the work that he might have seen do not seem to contain this passage.“forty ancestors” (shijisso四十祖): The seven buddhas, twenty-seven Indian ancestors of Zen from Mahākāśyapa through Prajñātāra, and six ancestors in China from Bodhidharma to Huineng 慧能. Calculation of the numbers in the lineage are complicated by the fact that traditional listings of the members typically count Bodhidharma twice, as both the twenty-eighth Indian and first Chinese ancestor; see Supplementary Notes, s.v. “Buddhas and ancestors.”“seven buddhas” (shichi butsu七佛): I.e., Śākyamuni and six buddhas said to have preceded him; commonly referred to as “the seven buddhas of the past” (kako shichi butsu過去七佛); see Supplementary Notes, s.v. “Seven buddhas.”</seg>

While Dōgen here treats Kāśyapa and Śākyamuni as master and disciple, the traditional understanding of the historical relationships among members of the list of seven buddhas is of course rather different from those in the Zen lineage. The lives of these buddhas do not overlap; rather, Kāśyapa’s career as a buddha (said to have lasted twenty-thousand years) ended long before the advent of Buddha Śākyamuni, and legends that place the latter among Kāśyapa’s followers refer to events in Śākayamuni’s previous lives as a bodhisattva, long before he was born as Siddhārtha and went on to attain awakening.

A teaching method also associated with Linji 臨 濟, based on a passage in the Linji lu 臨濟錄 (T.1985.47:497a22-23): 師晚參示衆云、有時奪人不奪境。有時奪境不奪人。有時人境俱奪。有時人境俱不奪。 At the evening convocation, the Master addressed the assembly saying, “Sometimes, I snatch away the person but don’t snatch away the object; sometimes, I snatch away the object but don’t snatch away the person; sometimes, I snatch away both person and object; sometimes, I don’t snatch away either person or object.” The saying is quoted and its interpretation by various masters recorded in the Rentian yanmu 人 天 眼目 (T.2006.48:300b6ff). “the four illuminations and applications” (shi shōyū四照用): Or “four understandings and applications.” Again, attributed to Linji 臨濟, though apparently not occurring in early versions of the Linji lu 臨濟錄. The Rentian yanmu 人天眼目 discussion (T.2006.48:304a10ff) begins with a quotation of Linji 臨濟: 師一日示衆云、我有時先照後用。有時先用後照。有時照用同時。有時照用不同時。先照後用有人在。先用後照有 法在。照用同時。驅耕夫之牛。奪饑人之食。敲骨取髓。痛下針錐。照用不同時。有問有答。立主立賓。合水和泥 應機接物。 One day, the Master addressed the assembly saying, Sometimes I illumine it first and apply it later; sometimes I apply it first and illumine it later; sometimes I illumine and apply it at the same time; sometimes I illumine and apply it not at the same time. When I illumine it first and apply it later, the person is there; when I apply it first and illumine it later, the dharma is there. When I illumine and apply it at the same time, I drive off the farmer’s ox; I steal the food of the starving man; I pound the bones and get the marrow; I needle the pain. When I illumine and apply it not at the same time, I have questions, I have answers; I set up the host and set up the guest; I accord with the water and harmonize with the mud, dealing with things in response to the opportunity. “the nine spheres” (kutai 九帶): An organization of Buddhist teachings attributed to Fushan Fayuan 浮山法遠 (991- 1067), in the Linji 臨濟 lineage. The Rentian yanmu 人天眼目 discusses them at T.2006.48:308a26-310b8, opening with this explanation: 浮山每於示徒之際、遍舉宗門語句。而學者編集、乞師名之。師因其類聚、目之曰佛禪宗教義九帶集。蓋擬班固九流 之作也。 Whenever Fushan addressed his followers, he widely cited the words of the school. Then his students collected them and begged the Master to name them. The Master categorized them according to type and called them the Fo chan zong jiaoyi jiudai ji (“Collection of the Nine Spheres of the Teachings of the Buddhist Zen School”), perhaps in imitation of Bangu’s Jiuliu (“Nine Currents”) [of early Chinese philosophy]. Sources give somewhat variant versions of the nine; the Rentian yanmu 人天眼目 (T.2006.48:308b1ff passim) has: (1) fo zhengfa yan zang dai 佛正法眼藏帶 (“the sphere of the treasury of the true dharma eye of the buddha”), (2) fofa zang dai 佛法藏帶 (“the sphere of the treasury of the dharma of the buddha”), (3) ri guan dai 理貫帶 (“the sphere of principle throughout”), (4) shi guan dai 事貫帶 (“the sphere of phenomena throughout”), (5) li shi zonghong dai 理事 縱橫帶 (“the sphere of principle and phenomena vertical and horizontal”), (6) ququ chui dai 屈曲垂帶 (“the sphere of letting down the crooked and bent”), (7) miao xie jian dai 妙協兼帶 (“the sphere of wondrous accord and combination”), (8) jin zhen shuang suo dai 金鍼雙鎖帶 (“the sphere of double stitch with a golden thread”), (9) ping huai chang shi dai 平懷常實帶 (“the sphere of normal affections always true”).</seg>

You’re also like this, I’m also like this, and all the ancestors of Sindh in the West [i. e., India] are also like this.” The English “express . . . as the realized kōan” strives to render Dōgen’s use here of the expression genjō kōan 見成 公案 (“realized case”) as a transitive verb, the agent of which is unexpressed; the translation takes it as Huineng’s words, but one might also assume an unstated “one” or “we.” See Supplementary Notes, s.v. “Realized kōan.” “protect it well” (zen ji go ji 善自護持): A common admonition to the student; while not in most versions of the Sixth Ancestor’s saying, its presence here may reflect its occurrence in the version recorded in the Rentian yanmu 人天眼目 (T.2006.48:322b3-4). have verified the accord in the present (ima ni shōkai seri いまに證契せり): Probably meaning that the truth of Huineng’s words are verified here and now.</seg>

The passage could be, and in some other editions is, parsed such that the phrase modifies the following sentence (in the section below) — a reading that would yield, “[Thinking that] because it ought to be like the voices of the sentient and the manner in which the sentient preach the dharma, to snatch away the voices of the sentient realm and liken them to the voices of the insentient realm is not the way of the buddhas.”</seg>

The term shō霄, translated here as “clouds,” can also refer to, and is probably most often interpreted here as, the “heavens,” or “firmament,” as well as the “night.” The term occurs elsewhere in the Shōbōgenzō only in “Dōtoku” 道得 (DZZ.1:376), probably in the sense “celestial passage.” transcends the commoner and surpasses the sage (chōbon osshō超凡越聖): I.e., to go beyond the stages of the Buddhist spiritual path; a common expression in Zen literature.</seg>

The terms ridō理道 and shuri 修理 are not common in Dōgen’s writing: the former might be parsed here as “reasoned words”; the latter, normally “to repair, “to put in order,” may have the sense here of “to train,” “to practice.” The term ryōri 料理 appears elsewhere in the Shōbōgenzō (“Jippō”十 方, DZZ.2:97) in the sense “to have control over, or mastery of [a topic]”; it could also be rendered “to reckon,” “to estimate,” or “to consider.”</seg>

You served me food, and I accepted it for you. When you paid your respects to me, I bowed my head. Where did I not instruct you on the essence of mind?” The second story alluded to here involves Weishan Lingyu 潙山靈祐 (771-853) and his disciples Yangshan Huiji 仰 山 慧寂 (807-883) and Xiangyan Zhixian 香 嚴 智 閑 (d. 898) (e.g., at Jingde chuandeng lu景 德 傳 燈 錄 , T.2076.51:265c16-21). Dōgen offers a Japanese translation of and commentary on the story in his “Shōbōgenzō jinzū”正法眼藏神通; he records a Chinese version in his shinji Shōbōgenzō眞字正法眼藏, DZZ.5:158, case 61: 大潙一日臥次、仰山來。師乃轉面向壁臥。仰曰、某甲是和尚弟子、不用形迹。師作起勢。仰便出。師召曰、寂子。 仰廻頭。師云、聽老僧説箇夢。仰低頭作聽勢。師曰、爲我原看。仰取一盆水、一條手巾來。師遂洗面了纔坐、香嚴 入來。師云、我適來與寂子作一上神通。不同小小。嚴曰、某甲在下面了了得知。師曰、子試道看。香嚴乃點一椀茶 來。師歎曰、二子神通智慧、過於鶖子・目連。One day, when Dawei [i.e., Weishan] was lying down, Yangshan came to him.

The Master said, “Listen while this old monk tells you of his dream.” Yang lowered his head as if to listen. The Master said, “Try interpreting it for me.” Yang brought him a basin of water and a hand towel. Dawei washed his face. As the Master finished washing his face and sat down, Xiangyan came in. The Master said, “Master Ji and I just did one surpassing spiritual power. It wasn’t like the little stuff.” Yan said, “I was down there; I know all about it.” The Master said, “Try saying something.” Xiangyan went and made a bowl of tea. The Master sighed, saying, “The spiritual power and wisdom of these two masters exceeds that of Śāriputra and Maudgalyāyana.” bringing the basin of water and pouring the water (kan sui rai, cha sui rai 盥水來、瀉水來): Allusion to Yangshan’s act of bringing the basin for Weishan in the story above, as well, perhaps, to a third story, involving Nanquan Puyuan 南泉普願 (748-835) and Deng Yinfeng 鄧隠峰 (dates unknown), that Dōgen quotes in the “Shōbōgenzōō saku sendaba”正法眼藏王索仙陀婆. Here is the version in his shinji Shōbōgenzō眞字正法眼藏 (DZZ.5:160, case 64): 南泉一日見鄧隠峰來、遂指淨瓶曰、淨瓶是境、瓶中有水。不得動著境、與老僧將水來。峰遂將瓶向南泉面前瀉。南 泉即休。 One day, when Nanquan saw Deng Yinfeng approaching, he pointed at a water flask and said, “The flask is an object; inside the flask, there is water.

It might be understood as a restatement of the preceding sentence: “obeisance I receive and obeisance I do,” or of the following sentence: “the self that makes obeisance and the other to whom obeisance is offered.” The form of the phrase suggests a possible play on the ubiquitous expression “self-benefit and benefiting others” (jiri rita 自利利他). “the one who offers obeisance and the one to whom obeisance is offered — their natures are empty and quiescent” (nō rai sho rai, shō kūjaku 能禮所禮、性空寂): A fixed phrase in Chinese, occurring fairly often in the Chinese Buddhist literature, from the opening line of a liturgical text known as Wenshu pusa lifo zuoguan ji 文殊菩薩 禮佛作觀偈 . (See, e.g., Qianshouyan dabeixin zhou xingfa 千手眼大悲心呪行法 , T.1950.46:974b21-22.) Dōgen’s teacher, Rujing, uses the line twice in the Hōkyō ki寶慶記 (DZZ.7:14; 24). The phrase immediately following here, “their natures are sloughed off” (shō datsuraku nari 性脱落なり), seems to represent Dōgen’s own comment on the line; see Supplementary Notes, s.v. “Slough off.”</seg>

(For this expression, see Supplementary Notes, s.v. “Body and mind sloughed off.”) Though the exact date is uncertain, Dōgen likely returned to Japan in the second half of 1227.

We know from more explicit accounts of this procedure in Buddhist monastic rules that the mixture of dirt and water is used to wash the area around the urethral opening (in males, the tip of the penis). The muddy water would then be rinsed off with clean water, but the directions given by Dōgen do not make that explicit.

They are, for example, like the case of the great king who calls for his ministers to bring him saindhava [“Sindhu-born”]. Saindhava is a single term with four referents: salt, a bowl, water, and a horse. These four things all have the same term. The wise minister well understands [how to interpret] this term. If the king requests saindhava when he is bathing, [the minister] offers him water; if the king requests saindhava when he is eating, he offers him salt; if the king requests saindhava when he will drink the broth after the food is brought, he offers him a bowl; if the kings requests saindhava when he will travel, he offers him a horse. In this way, the wise minister well interprets the fourfold cryptic words of the great king. The scriptures of the great vehicle similarly have four [senses of] “impermanence.” The wise ministers of the great vehicle should well understand them.</seg>

The sūtra is playing here on the technical term “mark” (sō相; S. lakṣana), which is used in reference to both (a) the attribute by which a thing is identified as being what it is, and (b) a member of the list of thirty-two distinctive features of the body of a buddha. Here is the original context in Kumārajīva’s translation of the sūtra (T.235.8:749a21-25): 須菩提、於意云何。可以身相見如來不。不也世尊。不可以身相得見如來。何以故。如來所説身相即非身相。佛告須 菩提。凡所有相皆是虚妄。若見諸相非相則見如來。“Subhūti, what do you think? Can one see the Tathāgata by his bodily marks?” “No, World-Honored One, one cannot see the Tathāgata by his bodily marks. Why? What are called the bodily marks of the Tathāgata are no-bodily-marks.” The Buddha addressed Subhūti, “Whatever marks there are, they are all deceptive. If one sees that marks are no-marks, one sees the Tathāgata.”</seg>

The Dongshan yulu 洞山語錄 (T.1986A.47:510b24-25) gives the question as: 問、三身之中、阿那身不墮衆數。 [A monk] asked, “Among the three bodies [of the buddha], which body doesn’t fall among the numbered?” Dōgen’s shinji Shōbōgenzō眞字正法眼藏(DZZ.5:152, case 55) has a variant version: 洞山因僧問、三身中那身説法。師曰、吾常於此切。僧後問曹山、洞山道吾常於此切、意旨云何。山云、要頭斫將去。 僧又問雪峰。峯以拄杖劈口打曰、我也曾到洞山來。Dongshan was asked by a monk, “Among the three bodies, which preaches the dharma?” The Master said, “I’m always close to this.” The monk later asked Caoshan [i.e., Caoshan Benzhi 曹山本寂, 840-901], “Dongshan said, ‘I’m always close to this.’ What does that mean?” Shan said, “If you want my head, cut it off and take it.” The monk again asked Xuefeng [i.e., Xuefeng Yicun 雪峰義存 (822-908)]. Feng struck him in the mouth with his staff and said, “I’ve been to Dongshan.”</seg>

This saying, though attributed by Baizhang to the Buddha, does not seem to occur in any Buddhist sūtra. The most likely source would seem to be a parable in the Nirvāṇa Sūtra (T.374.12:554a27ff) in which seven men enter the Ganges River. Six of them for various reasons fail to cross, but the seventh crosses to the other shore of the river, climbs a great mountain, and attains bliss without fear. The sūtra then relates the seven men to seven types of icchantika (those who have “cut off their good roots” [dan zenkon 斷善根]) who seek to cross “the great river of birth and death,” adding at the end (T.374.12:555a20-21), 善男子、彼岸山者喩於如來。受安樂者喩佛常住。大高山者喩大涅槃。 Sons of good family, the mountain of the other shore is comparable to the tathāgata; attaining ease and joy is comparable to the buddha’s permanently abiding; the great high mountain is comparable to the great nirvāṇa.</seg>

The reference is to Bodhidharma, the first Chinese ancestor in the Chan lineage; the term Shintan晨旦 represents a transliteration of a Sanskrit term for China, Cīnasthāna (“Land of the Qin”). “Each mind is like trees and rocks” (shinjin nyo bokuseki 心心如木石): Or “each thought is like wood and stone”; though somewhat awkward, the translation “mind” here seeks to retain a consistent English rendering of shin心 throughout. The expression “a mind like trees and rocks” (shin nyo bokuseki 心如木石) occurs often in Zen literature, including in the appended material to the Erru sixing lun 二入四行論attributed to Bodhidharma. (Yanagida Seizan 柳田 聖山, Daruma no goroku 達磨の語錄, Zen no goroku 禅の語錄 1:98.) Baizhang himself uses it in a description of the Chan teaching of sudden awakening (Jingde chuandeng lu 景德傳燈錄, T.2076.51:250a17-21):僧問、如何是大乘頓悟法門。師曰、汝等先歇諸緣休息萬事。善與不善世出世間、一切諸法莫記憶莫緣念。放捨身心 令其自在。心如木石無所辯別。心無所行心地若空。慧日自現如雲開日出。A monk asked, “What is the dharma gate of the sudden awakening of the great vehicle?” The Master answered, “First put to rest the various involvements and stop the myriad affairs. Do not recall, do not think about any dharmas, good or not good, mundane or transmundane. Cast aside body and mind, and set them free, so the mind is like trees and rocks, without disputation or distinction. When the mind is without activity, the ground of the mind is as the sky; the sun of wisdom appears of its own, like the sun emerging when the clouds part.” Dōgen is likely alluding to Baizhang’s text elsewhere in the Shōbōgenzō, in remarks such as “[the spiritual powers (jinzu 神通)] are the same as the Snowy Mountains, are like trees and rocks” (dō Sessen nari nyo bokuseki nari 同雪 山なり如木石なり) (“Shōbōgenzō jinzū”正法眼藏神通, DZZ.1:392), or “the Snowy Mountains have great awakening because of the Snowy Mountains; trees and rocks have great awakening through trees and rocks” (Sessen no Sessen no tame ni daigo suru ari bokuseki wa bokuseki o karite daigo su 雪山の雪山のために大悟するあり木石は木石をかり て大悟す) (“Shōbōgenzō daigo”正法眼藏大悟, DZZ.1:97).

Note that, though the compound grammatical subject here is gender inclusive, the offering of wives assumes a male donor. The practice of offering wives and children, as well as one’s own body, for the sake of awakening is celebrated in various Buddhist texts. One example occurs in the Lotus Sūtra (Miaofa lianhua jing妙法蓮華經, T.262.9:3a13-14), in a speech by the Bodhisattva Maitreya to which Dōgen will allude below (section 25): 復見菩薩、身肉手足、及妻子施、求無上道。 Again, I see bodhisattvas, Donating the flesh of their bodies, their arms and legs, As well as their wives and children, In their quest for the unsurpassedway. The most famous example of the offering of wives and children occurs in the story of Śākyamuni’s own previous life as the Bodhisattva Prince Sudāna (Xudana taizi 須達拏太子; better known in the Pali accounts as Vessantara), who practiced the virtue of charity by giving away his wife and children. (See, e.g., Taizi xudana jing 太子須大拏經, T.171.3:422a6ff.) The offering of one’s own flesh is reminiscent of the well-known story in the Prajñā-pāramitā- sūtra of the Bodhisattva Sadāprarudita (Changti pusa常啼菩薩), who offered to sell his body parts to a brahman in the course of his quest for the perfection of wisdom.

While mention of the flower (and occasionally of the “blink,” or “wink”) occurs in other accounts of the first transmission, the identification of the flower as an udumbara blossom seems to lack extant precedent.</seg>

Perhaps the most interesting reading might be that it is the sacred space they inhabit (“where are we here”) that makes the statements of the masters the words of buddhas and ancestors. “Where are we here?” (shari ze jūmo sho zai 這裏是什麼處在) is a fixed rhetorical question warning the interlocutor to keep the conversation at the highest level of truth, beyond dualities.

The expression “skin, flesh, bones, and marrow” (hi niku kotsu zui 皮肉骨髓) is commonly used by Dōgen for the essence or truth or entirety of something or someone, as handed down in the ancestral tradition of Zen; see Supplementary Notes, s.v. “Skin, flesh, bones, and marrow.” “The whole body hanging in space” evokes a verse on the wind chime by Dōgen’s teacher, Tiantong Rujing 天童如淨 (1162-1227), the first line of which Dōgen will quote below, section 13 (from Rujing heshang yulu 如淨和尚語錄, T.2002A.48:132b15-16):渾身似口掛虚空、不問東西南北風、一等爲他談般若、滴丁東了滴丁東。 Its whole body, like a mouth, hanging in empty space, Without asking if the winds are from east, west, south, or north, Equally, for them, it talks of prajñā: Di dingdong liao di dingdong.</seg>

The “nose grip” (habisu 把鼻子), or nose ring or rope by which one leads livestock, is a common metaphor for “getting a hold, or handle, on something”; see Supplementary Notes, s.v. “Nose.” The phrasing here perhaps reflects the words of Fuyan Wenyan 福嚴文演 of Tanzhou 潭州: 得這些巴鼻子了、便乃應用無窮。Once we’ve got this nose grip, then we should use it forever. “having a meal and stretching out to sleep” (kippan shinkyaku sui 喫飯伸脚睡): Likely reflecting Rujing’s 如淨 use of the phrase in his small convocation talk cited above (Rujing heshang yulu 如淨和尚語錄, T.2002A.48:129b2). The phrase is suggestive of “the four universal vows” of Haihui Shouduan 海會守端 (1025-1072) (e.g., at Liandeng huiyao聯燈會要, ZZ.136:671a18-b3):示衆云、釋迦老子有四弘誓願。煩惱無邊誓願斷。法門無邊誓願學衆生無邊誓願度。無上菩提誓願成。法華亦有四弘 誓願。飢來要喫飯。寒來要添衣。困來伸脚睡。熱處要風吹。 Addressing the assembly, he said, “Old man Śākyamuni had four universal vows. The afflictions are limitless; I vow to sever them. The dharma gates are limitless; I vow to study them. Living beings are limitless; I vow to deliver them. Unsurpassed bodhi, I vow to attain it. Fahua [i.e., Shouduan] also has four universal vows. When I’m hungry, I want a meal. When it’s cold, I want warm robes. When I’m tired, I stretch out and sleep. When the place is hot, I want a breeze.” right here for thirty years (zai shari sanjū nen 在這裏三十年): Based on a conventional number of years of practice that it takes to master Chan. “Right here” (zai shari 這裏) likely indicates the monastery, but may also suggest the spiritual state of having “got this nose grip.”</seg>

Dōgen, who also mentions this tradition in his Eihei kōroku永平廣錄 (DZZ.4:62, no. 482), may be reflecting the Biyan lu 碧巖錄, case 62 (T.2003.48:194a2-3): 肇乃禮羅什爲師。又參瓦棺寺跋陀婆羅菩薩、從西天二十七祖處。 Sengzhao then paid obeisance to Kumārajīva, and also visited the Bodhisattva Bhadrapāla of the Waguansi, who came from the Twenty-seventh Ancestor in Sindh in the West. The tradition seems to rest on a conflation of the name Bhadrapāla with Buddhabhadra (Fotuobatuoluo 佛陀跋陀羅, 359-429), the famed Indian translator active in China during the time of Sengzhao; it ignores, of course, the century separating the two supposed disciples of Prajñātāra.</seg>

As she grew, the robe also enlarged. When she developed faith in the buddha dharma and later left home, this robe turned into the five robes [of the bhikṣuṇī].

Zhiduo質多 [S. citta] is the pronunciation of Sindhu; here, we say xin心 — i.e., the thinking “mind.” In Sindhu, there is also the term wulituo 汚栗馱 [S. hṛdaya], which here is called [xin心 in the sense] the “heart” [or “core”] of grasses and trees. There is also yilituo 矣栗馱 [S. vṛddha (?)], which here is [xin心 in the sense] the “heart” [or “pith”] of accumulated spiritual essence. The Sanskrit original of Zhiyi’s third term here is uncertain: some scholars have suggested vṛddha (“expanded,” “developed”), while others take yilituo 矣栗馱 simply as an alternative transliteration of hṛdaya, here treated as a separate Sanskrit term.

At the time, there was a Buddha named Śākyamuni, with disciples named Śāriputra, Maudgalyāyana, and Ānanda. The Buddha and his disciples lodged together for a night at the place of the tile-maker. At that time, the tile-maker donated three things — grass seats, lamps, and rock sugar syrup. Offering them to the Buddha and the bhikṣu saṃgha, he made a vow, saying, “In the future, in the world of the five evils afflicted by old age, sickness, and death, I shall become a buddha. Like the present buddha, my name shall be Śākyamuni, and my buddha disciples’ names shall also be like the names of the disciples of the present buddha.” Dōgen tells this story in his Eihei kōroku永平廣錄 (DZZ.3.120, no. 182) and goes on himself to make a vow to become a buddha named Śākyamuni.</seg>

The Dasheng yi zhang 大乘 義章 (T.1851.44:654a17) has here simply the less problematic fotuo 佛陀 (Japanese butsuda; “buddha”). in Cīnasthāna, it is translated “awakening” (Shintan ni wa kaku to honzu 震旦には覺と翻ず): “Cīnasthāna” (Shintan 震旦) is a Sanskrit name for China (“Land of the Qin”). The Japanese kaku覺 most often renders Sanskrit bodhi (“awakening”); presumably, Dōgen wants us to understand here “awakened one — one with unsurpassed, perfect awakening” (mujō shōtō kaku 無上正等覺).

See Supplementary Notes, s.v. “Skin, flesh, bones, and marrow” and “Break into a smile.” 4 Those who do not learn the way of the buddhas, who do not enter the chambers of the ancestors (butsudō o narawazu, soshitsu ni irazaran 佛道をならはず、祖室にいらざらん ): I.e., those outside of Dōgen’s tradition of the buddhas and ancestors; a point reiterated in the seventy-five-chapter Shōbōgenzōtext of the “Shin fukatoku,” section 2. 5 Deshan (Tokusan 德山): The retelling of the Deshan story in this section of our text corresponds to sections 3-6 of the seventy-five-chapter Shōbōgenzōtext of the “Shin fukatoku.” not much of a man (fujōbu 不丈夫): From the common Chinese usage of zhangfu 丈夫 for the manly male. 6 Longtan (Ryūtan 龍潭): A reference to Longtan Chongxin 龍潭崇信 (dates unknown; a disciple of Tianhuang Daowu 天皇道悟 [748-807], in the lineage of Qingyuan 青原) with whom Deshan would subsequently study.7 What a pity (uramu beshi うらむべし): This section parallels material in sections 7-8 of the seventy-five-chapter Shōbōgenzōtext of the “Shin fukatoku.” 8 that person (sono hito その人): I.e., a true master. 9 the eminent ancestor of Yunmen and Fayan (Unmon Hōgen no kōso 雲門・法眼の高祖): I.e., an ancestor in the lineage leading to the Yunmen 雲門 and Fayan 法眼 houses of Chan. This line has no parallel in the seventy-five- chapter Shōbōgenzōtext. 10 When we think about this episode (kono innen o omou ni この因緣をおもふに): This section parallels material in section 8 of the seventy-five-chapter Shōbōgenzōtext of the “Shin fukatoku.” 11 we are not without reasons to doubt the old woman here (ima bashi o gijaku suru koto, yue naki ni arazu いま 婆子を疑著すること、 ゆえ なきにあらず): This section parallels material in section 9 of the seventy-five-chapter Shōbōgenzōtext of the “Shin fukatoku.” 12 the radiance and auspicious signs of the old buddhas (kobutsu no kōmyō mo genzui mo 古佛の光明も現瑞も): I.e., the nimbus surrounding the body of a buddha and the miraculous portents of his actions.

This and the following two sections have no parallel in the seventy-five-chapter Shōbōgenzōtext of the “Shin fukatoku,” which concludes with Dōgen’s suggestions on how the conversation between Deshan and the old woman could be improved. 13 we are not saying of the mind that there is a mind that, for now, we call “cannot be got” (shin o shibaraku, fukatoku to nazukuru shin ari, to wa iwazu 心をしばらく、不可得となづくる心あり、とは云はず): Presumably, meaning something like, “it is not that ‘cannot be got’ is an attribute of the mind.”14 a buddha mind that is “fences, walls, tiles, and pebbles” (shō heki ga ryaku nite aru busshin ari 牆壁瓦礫にて 在る佛心在り): Allusion to a well-known saying in Chan texts first attributed to Nanyang Huizhong 南陽慧忠 (d. 775). See Supplementary Notes, s.v. “Fences, walls, tiles, and pebbles.” 15 there is [the case in which] the “it cannot be got” that is the “mountains, rivers, and the whole earth” exists in itself (senga daichi nite aru fukatoku no, onozukara nite aru ari 山河大地にてある不可得の、自にて在るあり): A tentative rendering of an odd locution. “Mountains, rivers, and the whole earth” (senga daichi 山河大地) is a fixed expression occurring often in Chan texts; here, perhaps, reflecting a conversation between Weishan Lingyou 潙山靈 祐 (771-853) and his disciple Yangshan Huiji 仰山慧寂 (803-887) recorded in Dōgen’s shinji Shōbōgenzō眞字正法眼 藏 (DZZ.5:212, case 168); see Supplementary Notes, s.v. “Sun, moon, and stars.”16 “one should produce a thought that does not abide anywhere” (ō mushojū, ni shō go shin 應無所住、而生其心): From the famous line in the Diamond Sūtra (Jingang bore boluomi jing 金剛般若波羅蜜經, T.235.8:749c22-23), on hearing which it is said the future Sixth Ancestor, Huineng 慧能, was awakened. 17 the National Teacher Dazheng (Daishō kokushi 大證國師): Dōgen begins here his discussion of material found in the “Shōbōgenzō tashin tsū”正法眼藏他心通. His Japanese retelling of the encounter between Huizhong and Daer here corresponds to the Chinese version in section 1 of that text. His comments in the following two sections, however, while consistent with his treatment there, have no exact parallel. 18 the myriad dharmas are the mind (manbō sunawachi shin nari 萬法即ち心なり): Japanese rendering of the phrase wanfa jixin 萬法即心, occurring in Chan texts (see, e.g., Zongjing lu宗鏡錄, T.2016.48:603c25). the three realms are only mind (sangai yui shin 三界唯心): A very common expression found throughout Chan literature as well as other Chinese texts of the Mahāyāna; see Supplementary Notes, s.v. “The three realms are only mind.”19 this buddha is this mind itself (ze butsu soku shin 是佛即心): Playing with the well-known expression “this mind itself is the buddha” (soku shin ze butsu 即心是佛); see Supplementary Notes. 20 spiritual knowledge of the way of the buddhas (butsudō no chitsū佛道の智通): Probably meaning “paranormal knowledge as it is properly understood in the way of the buddhas.” The term chitsū知通 (“spiritual knowledge”), occurring here and in the following section, is not found elsewhere in the Shōbōgenzō; it is synonymous with jinzū神 通 (“spiritual powers”; S. abhijñā). See Supplementary Notes, s.v. “Spiritual powers.” 21 all the mind (jinshin盡心): In parallel with “all the earth”; or, perhaps, “all minds,” in parallel with “all dharmas.” In common parlance, the term jinshin 盡心 means “to exhaust the mind” in wholehearted effort.22 though he may have been born to meet a guide of humans and devas (ninchū tenjō no dōshi ni umareau to iedomo 人中・天上の導師にうまれあふといへども): I.e., though he had the opportunity to encounter Huizhong, of whom tradition held that he was teacher, on earth, to the emperors of China and, in the heavens, to Indra, king of the gods. 23 Deva Lord (Tentai 天帝): I.e., Indra, king of the gods. 24 heir apparent (fusho 補處): I.e., a bodhisattva destined to become the next buddha. 25 ten sages and three worthies (jisshō sanken十聖三賢): Also read jisshō sangen. Reference to those on the path of the bodhisattva: the ten stages, or “grounds” (chi地; S. bhūmi), of the “sage,” or “noble” (shō聖; S. ārya), ones — i.e., those on the advanced levels of the path — and the three types of “wise,” or “worthy” (ken 賢; S. bhadra) ones — i.e., those on the level just preceding the ārya. 26 A monk asked Zhaozhou (sō mon Jōshū僧問趙州): This section (throughout which Dōgen switches back and forth between Chinese quotation and Japanese translation) corresponds to the Chinese text in section 2 of the “Shōbōgenzō tashin tsū.” 27 Duan of Haihui (Kaie Tan 海會端): Our version here is missing some text; the original, given in full in the “Shōbōgenzō tashin tsū”and also below, section 27, has: 國師若在三藏鼻孔上、有什麼難見、殊不知國師在三藏眼睛裏。 If the National Teacher was on the Tripiṭaka Master’s nose, why would it be hard to see him? He’s completely unaware that the National Teacher was in the Tripiṭaka Master’s eye. 28 These five venerables (kono goi sonshuku この五位尊宿): This section corresponds to material in section 3 of the “Shōbōgenzō tashin tsū.” 29 Kōshō興聖: Dōgen uses the custom of referring to himself in the third person by the name of his monastery, Kōshōji 興聖寺. This section loosely corresponds to sections 4-6 in the “Shōbōgenzō tashin tsū.” 30 he should have learned from the buddha dharma (buppō ni narau beki nari 佛法にならふべきなり): Perhaps meaning, “he should have understood in terms of the buddha dharma.”31 treasure trove (hōsho 寳所): The metaphor of the treasure trove as the true goal of Buddhism comes from a famous parable in the Lotus Sūtra, in which the buddha is depicted as a caravan leader, taking people to a treasure (Miaofa lianhua jing妙法蓮華經, T.262.9:25c26ff). 32 had it been like the first two times (zen sando no gotoku araba 前三度の如くあらば): Reading zen ryōdo 前兩度 (“the first two times”) for the problematic zen sando (“the first three times”). This section corresponds to sections 7- 8 in the “Shōbōgenzō tashin tsū.” 33 Secondly (ni ni 二に): This section corresponds to the first part of section 9 of the “Shōbōgenzō tashin tsū.” 34 Clearly, we should be firmly convinced of this principle (kono dōri, akiraka ni ketsujō su beshi この道理、あきら かに決定すべし): This section parallels material in section 9 of the “Shōbōgenzō tashin tsū.” 35 Now we need to see through each of our five venerables (ima goi sonshuku, tomo ni kanpa su beshi いま五位尊 宿、ともに勘破すべし): Paralleling section 16 of the “Shōbōgenzō tashin tsū.” 36 Zhaozhou (Jōshū趙州): Paralleling section 17 in the “Shōbōgenzō tashin tsū.” 37 Xuansha (Gensha 玄沙): Paralleling section 18 in the “Shōbōgenzō tashin tsū.” 38 Yangshan (Kyōzan仰山): Paralleling section 19 in the “Shōbōgenzō tashin tsū.” 39 granting a prediction of becoming a buddha (juki sabutsu 授記作佛): Presumably, Dōgen’s point here is that, if knowledge of another’s mind is limited to the ordinary mind that “plays across objects,” the buddhas would be unable to predict (as they are held to do) the future buddhahood of the advanced adept. 40 Xuansha (Gensha 玄沙): Corresponding to section 21 in the “Shōbōgenzō tashin tsū.” 41 When we take Xuansha’s saying as saying something (Gensha no dō o dō to suru toki 玄沙の道を道とするとき): Corresponding to section 22 in the “Shōbōgenzō tashin tsū.” 42 Duan of Haihui (Kaie Tan 海會端): Corresponding to the first part of section 23 of the “Shōbōgenzō tashin tsū.” 43 The five venerables (goi sonshuku 五位尊宿 ): This section corresponds to material in sections 24-25 of the “Shōbōgenzō tashin tsū.” 44 made mistakes of mistakes (shōshaku jushaku 將錯就錯): A fixed expression occurring several times in the Shōbōgenzō; often understood in the sense, “to recognize a mistake for what it is,” but here more likely simply something like “to make mistake after mistake”; see Supplementary Notes, s.v. “Make a mistake of a mistake.” 45 “What is the old buddha mind?” (ika ni aranu ka kore kobutsushin いかにあらぬかこれ古佛心): A well-known dialogue (see, e.g., Jingde chuandeng lu景德傳燈錄, T.2076.51:438a9), appearing several times in Dōgen’s writings (although not in the “Shōbōgenzō tashin tsū”). 46 “What is the constantly abiding mind of the buddhas?” (ika ni aran ka kore shobutsu jōjū shin いかにあらんか これ諸佛常住心): The source of this dialogue is unknown (and the significance of Huizhong’s response is unclear). Again, not a dialogue appearing in the “Shōbōgenzō tashin tsū.” 47 Deva Lord Śakra (Ten Taishaku 天帝釋): I.e., the god Indra, in whose heaven it is said Huizhong preached. The source of this dialogue, absent in the “Shōbōgenzō tashin tsū,” is unknown. 48 The “Shin fukatoku” of the seventy-five-chapter Shōbōgenzō adds here “Number 8” (daihachi 第八). 49 This date represents a correction, found in the Honzan edition, of the era name Hōji 寶治 given in the HimitsuShōbōgenzōMS colophon; the second year of Hōji would have been 1248, the senior earth year of the monkey (boshin 戊申), long after Dōgen had left Kōshōji.Dates of the summer retreat vary; a common practice put it from the sixteenth of the fourth lunar month through the fifteenth of the seventh lunar month; in 1241, the equivalent of 28 May through 23 August.</seg>

Once, when the Buddha was traveling, he came upon two boys playing in the sand. One of them put some sand in the Buddha’s begging bowl. The Buddha accepted it, smiled, and emitted a multi-colored light from his body that reached throughout the three-thousandfold world and then returned. When Ānanda questioned the Buddha, he replied (T.2043.50:132a26-b2.): 阿難、汝見小兒以手捧沙置鉢中不。阿難白佛、唯然已見。世尊又言、此兒者我入涅槃百年後、當生波咤利弗多城王名阿 育。爲四分轉輪王信樂正法。當廣供養舍利起八萬四千塔饒益多人。 “Ānanda, did you see the boy offer sand to the bowl?” Ānanda said to the Buddha, “Just so, I saw it.” The World-Honored One continued, “One hundred years after my entrance into nirvāṇa, this boy will be born as a king of Pātaliputra named Aśoka. He will become a wheel-turning king of the four quarters, having faith in the true dharma. He will make offerings widely to the śarīra, erect 84,000 stūpas, and benefit many people.”</seg>

The use of the past tense here (nite arikeru にて有りける) and below suggests that Dōgen has in mind the historical advent of Buddha Śākyamuni.

You’re three inches from the hook. Why don’t you say something?” Jia was about to open his mouth, when the Master hit him with the boat pole, knocking him into the water. When Jia reemerged and climbed back in the boat, the Master said, “Say something! Say something!” Again, Jai was about to speak, and again the Master hit him. With that, Jiashan suddenly had a great awakening.</seg>

The latter term occurs less frequently but appears prominently in “Shōbōgenzō sangai yui shin”正法眼藏三界唯心: 諸佛應化法身は、みなこれ三界なり、無外なり。たとへば、如來の無外なるがごとし、牆壁の無外なるがごとし、 三界の無外なるがごとく、衆生無外なり The response, transformation, and dharma bodies of the buddhas are all the three realms, are without outside. This is like the tathāgatas being without outside, like fences and walls being without outside; just as the three realms are without outside, living beings are without outside. The seventy-five-chapter Shōbōgenzōversion replaces this sentence with a greatly expanded passage: しばらく二祖なにとしてか西天にゆかざる。いはゆる碧眼の眼睛裏に跳入するゆえに、不往西天なり。もし碧眼裏 に跳入せずば、必定して西天にゆくべし。抉出達磨眼睛を遍參とす。西天にゆき東土にきたる、遍參にあらず。天 台・南嶽にいたり、五臺・上天にゆくをもて、遍參とするにあらず。四海五湖、もし透脱せざらんは、遍參にあら ず。四海五湖に往來するは、四海五湖をして遍參せしめず、路頭を滑ならしむ、脚下を滑ならしむ、ゆえに遍參を 打失せしむ。 Now, why did the Second Ancestor not go to Sindh in the West? Because he jumped into the eye of Blue Eyes, he “didn’t go to Sindh in the West.” If he had not jumped into Blue Eyes, he would definitely have gone to Sindh in the West. He made gouging out Dharma’s eye his extensive study. Going to Sindh in the West or coming to the Land of the East is not extensive study. Going to Tiantai or Nanyue is not extensive study; we do not take going to Wutai or the heavens as extensive study. If we have not transcended the four seas and five lakes, it is not extensive study. Coming and going to the four seas and five lakes does not make the four seas and five lakes study extensively: it makes the road slippery; it makes the footing slippery; hence, it makes one lose extensive study.</seg>

Thus, “there being a time” renders uji 有時 (“sometimes”); “there being a shape” renders ugyō有形 (“having shape”); “there being conditions” renders u’en 有緣 (“conditioned”); “realm of being” renders uchi 有地, here, likely a playful opposite of “realm of nothingness” (mu sho’u chi 無處有地); “there being a beginning” (ushi 有始) and “there being a coming” (urai 有來) represent what is likely a play on “from beginningless time” (mushirai 無始來); “there being a change” (uhen 有變) and “there being a transformation” (uke 有化) bisect the compound henka 變化 (“transformation”); and, finally, “there being an accomplishment” (ujō有成; “completion”) and “there being an appearance” (uken 有見; “visible”; also “having views”; “view of existence”) are here likely playing on genjō見成 (“realization,” “manifestation,” etc.).</seg>
