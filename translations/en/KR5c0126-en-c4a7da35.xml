I read this very differently than Lynn, the idea is that (following Cheng Xuanying) if one promotes 德 it hinders the natural functioning of one's 性. It appears he is following Wang Shumin's emendation. However, Cheng Xuanying and the earlier commentators straightforwardly read 塞.  He is letting the later textual scholarship guide his translation here, despite his claim to read it as Guo Xiang would have.</seg>

Its understanding is confined. This same point is made in chapter one. "Devotion" has odd connotations here.) </seg>

"Bumpkin" has the unwarranted connotation of a hillbilly in the deep south of the US. </seg>

This stuff just happens without Ruo knowing how or why. Despite being grander than the Earl of the River, he is not preoccupied with himself.</seg>
