I read this very differently than Lynn, the idea is that (following Cheng Xuanying) if one promotes 德 it hinders the natural functioning of one's 性. It appears he is following Wang Shumin's emendation. However, Cheng Xuanying and the earlier commentators straightforwardly read 塞.  He is letting the later textual scholarship guide his translation here, despite his claim to read it as Guo Xiang would have.</seg>

The general "it is not known" is not invited by GX's commentary. This stuff just happens without Ruo knowing how or why. Despite being grander than the Earl of the River, Ruo is not preoccupied with himself. NB: GX's annotation calls to mind WP's annotation on the Dismissive Quail vis-a-vis Phoenix (ZZ 1): the small should not resent the "largeness" of the large, and the large should not be haughty regarding their "largeness" vis-a-vis "the small". </seg>

Here, on the contrary, the Heavenly definitively means the natural, while the Human means the deliberate and artificial; the two terms have definite contents, these can be unproblematically known, and “Virtuosity resides in the Heavenly.” Compare Chapters 8 and 9, which also offer a fixed definition of the content of the Heavenly inborn nature."</seg>

This tradition begins with Sima Biao, who glosses ji as zhaozhen (portent), the subtle and mysterious incipiency that sages discern in the workings of Heaven and Earth; see Zhuanzi jishi, 3: 625. However, the latter was the minority view during premodern times and came to prominence only in the modern era, with the likes of Ma Xulun (1884–1970), in Zhuangzi yizheng (Documentary evidence for meanings in the Zhuangzi), in which he glosses ji as zhong zhi jiwei er wanwu suoyou shengzhe (“the most minute of seeds from which the myriad things are generated”), 18: 6a; and Hu Shi (1891–1962), in Xian Qin mingxue shi (History of logic in the pre-Qin era), 113, where he glosses ji as jingwei de yuanzi (“most miniscule atom”) or peiya (“germ/gemmule”). Reading zhong as “seed” instead of “species” is also characteristic of this tradition."</seg>
