I read this very differently than Lynn, the idea is that (following Cheng Xuanying) if one promotes 德 it hinders the natural functioning of one's 性. It appears he is following Wang Shumin's emendation. However, Cheng Xuanying and the earlier commentators straightforwardly read 塞.  He is letting the later textual scholarship guide his translation here, despite his claim to read it as Guo Xiang would have.</seg>
