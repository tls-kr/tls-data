<p>1. Probably most current and most ancient word for a mould is xíng 型. The term refers to moulds made of earthenware, which were in ancient China used to cast bronze artefacts, particularly vessels and bells. To cast a vessel or a bell, it was necessary to use several moulds joined together. After having finished casting, the moulds had to be broken to obtain an artefact; each bronze artefact was hence a unique piece. Whole process required very good coordination, and its mastering enabled production of bronzes in a large scale. Many finds of broken earthen moulds are known from bronze foundries dating from the Shang to the Han period. This method of casting was very typical for ancient China; note that lost wax method came to use in China only in the sixth century B.C. and it was probably adopted from the West. In Han times, earthen moulds were also used to cast iron. In that period, iron cast moulds which had not to be broken and thus enabled really mass production, also came to use. (Note that in the West iron was not cast before the fourteenth century.)</p>
<p>2. Fàn 范 / 笵 also refers to a mould. I have not found any evidence that it was made of bamboo; XUNZI refers to the fàn 范 / 笵 which is together with xíng 型 used to cast metal sword, and it is highly improbable for a bamboo mould to be used to cast metal. WANG suggests that fàn 范 / 笵 refers to the moulds made of metal, but I have not found anything to support this opinion. Perhaps the word is only another term for xíng 型, or it refers to a bamboo mould for things other than metal.</p>
<p>NB: Mó 模 (in HANYU DACIDIAN: vol. 4, pp. 1208 as mú)4 is a post-Han word for a mould. It can be made of wood, but also of other materials like metal or earthenware.</p>
