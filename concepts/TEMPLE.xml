<div type="old-chinese-criteria">
<p>1. The most common word for an ancestral temple in ancient China was miào 廟, and this word refers to the royal ancestral temple as well as to the ancestral temples of feudal lords and senior officials and even ordinary shì 士 "gentlemen, freemen". The Son of Heaven had seven of these, feudal lords had five, dàfū 大夫 had three and ordinary freemen had one. Ordinary people sacrificed in the qǐn 寢 "back room (also used as bedroom)" where the altar would traditionally occupy the north-western corner.</p>
<p>2. Zōng 宗 "founding ancestor of a clan" is used by synecdoche to refer to the permanent ancestral temple where he is venerated together with his deceased successors. The word has an archaic flavour.</p>
<p>3. Tiāo 祧 is a technical term for a shrine, sometimes specifically a non-permanent shrine for a distant ancestor, a shrine that could be removed and replaced by a mere altar. In the common combination zōng tiā1o 宗祧 it would appear that tiāo 祧 refers to a shrine within the larger temple complex.</p>
<p>4. Cí 祠 referred originally to a small temple built near a grave where the deceased were venerated, but the term came to be used more generally to refer to a private family temple where both ancesters and other divinities of all kinds were venerated. These establishments could be very large in large clans, and very small in small clans.</p>
<p>5. The case of qǐn 寢 is historically very complex. Four uses of the word must be distinguished. A. Qǐn 寢 referred in Spring and Autumn times to a part of the miào 廟 attached to it at as a back-room qǐn 寢 which was a luxuriously appointed bedroom for the use of the ancestors, where these could sleep and where they were also served as if alive (although these concrete practices are first mentioned in Han sources). B. In Warring States times the qǐn 寢 was moved to the vicinity of royal tombs to serve as a place of worship. See TOMB. C. Also, the term referred to the back room behind the formal main hall in which the spirits were venerated (in private homes in the north-western corner).</p>

<p>Ta3 refers to a type of Buddhist architecture and is a translation of skr. stuupa. Originally stuupa was used for the places where the remains of SSakyamuuni were supposed to be stored. Eventually stuupas were also erected at places where things like Buddhist scriptures, relicts, etc. were buried. Basically there were several kinds of stuupa types transmitted to China. The earliest ta3 was erected in the Ba2ima3 白馬 monastery in Luo4ya2ng, a wooden stuupa in the center of the temple. In the second century the first nine-storied wooden pagodas appeared which eventually became very popular in China. Between the Eastern Han and the Six Dynasties the erection of pagodas became common in China (in LUOYANG QIELANJI ca. 17 pagodas are mentioned. In Fa3-yua4n zhu1-li2n 法苑珠林 more than 1,000 pagodas in the area of Mt. Wu3ta2i 五台 alone are mentioned). During the time of the Six Dynasties certain features became common for the building of a pagoda, e.g. six stories, rectangular shape, each side having three gates and six windows, the colour of the gate usually being bright;  several bells on top and in other places of the pagoda, etc. At that time pagodas were erected on a large basement symbolizing Mt. Sumeru (i.e. the Buddhist center of the world) and the pagoda itself was made of wood. However, there was also a small number of stone pagodas built during the Northern Wei which influenced the architecture of stone-pagodas which became popular during and after the Tang. The earliest preserved brick pagoda (zhua1n-ta3 磚塔) dates form 523 (Northern Wei), with 12 sides, built of yellow bricks. During the Sui and Tang, the building of pagodas reached new heights and the shape and size of pagodas became even more diversified. During the Five Dynasties period especially in South-China numberless pagodas were built. Wheras the pagoda was the central structure in monasteries during the Six Dynasties period, pagodas during the Tang did not have this function any longer. From this period only a small number of wooden pagodas servived; however there are many brick-pagodas still existing from that time. The prevailing shape was still rectangular and there were three main types of pagoda buildings. Most of the pagodas preserved from the Tang period are tomb pagodas (mu4-ta3 墓塔) of monks and ta3 in ZTJ usually refers to this type of pagoda. Most of those are built of stone or brick. The most regular type is rectangular, but some consist of six or eight angles or are built in a round shape. The size of these pagodas is not very big and most of them have a height of three to four meters.</p>

            <def>The most common word for an ancestral temple in ancient China was miào 廟, and this word refers to the royal ancestral temple as well as to the ancestral temples of feudal lords and senior officials and even ordinary shì 士 "gentlemen, freemen". The Son of Heaven had seven of these, feudal lords had five, dàfū 大夫 had three and ordinary freemen had one. Ordinary people sacrificed in the qǐn 寢 "back room (also used as bedroom)" where the altar would traditionally occupy the north-western corner.
