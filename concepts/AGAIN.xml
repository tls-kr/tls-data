<p>再 is the current modern word for "again" and its meaning derives from the meaning "twice", and the repeated action is typically (but not always) in the future.</p>
<p>又 contrasts notoriously with 再 in many other meanings, but when it means "again", the reference is typically to a repeated action in the past or in the present. [Add references to the extensive literature on this distinction.]</p>
<p>復 (lit) "again" is current only in epistolary style.</p>
<p>重複</p>
<p>再三</p>
<p>來回</p>
<p>又要 refers to repeated action in the future.</p>
<p>還 does not primarily refer to repetition but to doing something X in addition to something else Y.</p>
<p>重 chóng "repeatedly" is usually a bound form in modern Chinese.</p>
<p>反覆 "again and again" focusses on multiple repetition.</p>

<div type="old-chinese-contrasts">
<p>1. Fù 復 can be negated to mean "no more, no longer" (Ban Zhao, NJ); yòu 又 cannot be so negated.</p>
<p>2. Fù 復 can refer to regaining things (CC fù sū 復穌 "come to life again"); yòu 又 cannot be so used.</p>
<p>3. Fù 復 always refers to the repetition of the same kind of action; yòu 又 can refer to the same kind of action, but it can also present a list of significantly comparable actions.</p>
<p>4. When the particles link to occurrences of basically the same event, then difference between them is that fù 復 invites us to dwell on the sameness of the events, and yòu 又 invites us to dwell on their separate occurrence. Since yòu 又 emphasises the difference in this case, it is natural that the word can also be used when in fact the events show considerable difference.</p>
<p>5. Fù dé 復得 is "to retrieve", yòu dé 又得 is "to get another one".</p>
<p>6. Fù shēng 復生 "be reborn" and gèng shēng 更生 "be born again" (ZHUANG 19), sù shēng 甦生 "be born again" contrasts with yòu shēng 又生 "also give birth to"</p>
<p>7. Fù lì 復立 "arise anew" contrasts with yòu lì 又立 "establish in addition" and gèng lì 更立 "establish as replacement".</p>

<p>1. WL claims that za4i 再 always means "twice" and claims that the word only came to mean "again" in the 近代 period.  In fact, za4i 再 certainly does often mean "twice", but there is a wide range of current cases where the word means not "twice" but "a second time".  Significantly, even the SHUOWEN explanation of the word suggests this second meaning.</p>
<p>2. WL does not begin to appreciate the basic differences between the two words for again.  WL 99 glosses yo4u 又 as fu4 復.  Compare this identification of meaning with the contrasts elaborated in SSC under the heading of AGAIN.</p>
