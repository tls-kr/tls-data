<p>Mt. So1ng 嵩 is situated in He2na2n 河南 province, in the north of the De1ngfe1ng 登封 district. Other names for the mountain are Zho1ngyue4 中嶽, Mt. So1ngga1o 嵩高, Mt. Cho2ng 崇. Mt. So1ng is one of the five famous mountains (wu3-yue4 五嶽) in China. The two main peaks of Mt. So1ng are Mt. Ta4ishi4 太室 (east) and Mt. Xia3oshi4 小室 (west). The mountain was originally associated with Daoism and many hermits resided on it. Mt. Sha3oshi4 became later  known for the Sha4oli2n 少林 monastery which was originally built in 496 for the Indian meditation specialist Ba2tuo2 跋陀 (or: Fo2tuo2 佛陀, the teacher of the famous monk Se1ngcho2u 僧稠 who had considerable influence on the formation of the early Cha2n school). According to Cha2n historiography the First Patriarch Bodhidharma resided in the monastery from ca. 520-528. The monastery became also a center of the 'Northern' Cha2n school in the early period of the Tang dynasty. Several more monasteries were built on the mountain, the Fa3wa2ng 法王 monastery, the Hui4sha4n 會善 monastery, and the Yo3ngta4i 永泰 monastery (Foguang: 5441c-5442c; Anderl 1995: 12, fn.31).</p>

  <def>Cáoxī 曹溪 originally refers to a river situated in the southeast of today's Qǔjiāng 曲江 district, Guǎngdōng procince. In 502 A.D. the Indian monk Zhìyào 智藥 constructed a monastery at the mouth of the river and called in Bǎolín 寶林 monastery. Around 677 the monk Huìnéng 惠能 and retrospective 'Sixth Patriarch' settled at the monastery. The place of his teaching activities was usually referred to as Mt. Cáoxī 曹溪, Mt. Cáo 曹 or Mt. Dòng 洞.</def>
