<div type="old-chinese-criteria">
<p>1. The general term for all forms of mourning dress, including the garments themselves and everything worn on them, was sāng 喪, and this term designates such articles of clothing insofar as they are used for their purpose.</p>
<p>2. Cuī 衰／縗 refers specifically to the garment worn in mourning.</p>
<p>3. Dié 絰 refers to the belt of coarse hemp worn in mourning.</p>
<p>4. Cuī dié 衰絰 refers in a general way to all the gear that makes up mourning dress, and quite frequently to the wearing of such gear, and I suspect that these terms would also refer to mourning dresses that are stored and not currently used in ritual contexts, but this needs to be investigated..</p>
