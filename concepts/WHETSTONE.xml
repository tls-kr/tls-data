<p>1. Lì 礪 refers to the whetstone which is - according to the SHUOWEN - rather crude. [HANYU DACIDIAN: vol. 7, pp. 1116; WANG 1993; 228]</p>
<p>2. Lì 厲 is another (perhaps more archaic) term for the lì 礪; it is known already from SHIJING: HANYU DACIDIAN: vol. 1, pp. 936; YANG 2000: 57 - 58; WANG 1993; 228]</p>
<p>3. Dǐ 砥 refers to the finer whetstone than lì 礪. [HANYU DACIDIAN: vol. 7, pp. 1020; WANG 1993; 228]</p>
<p>4. Zhi 底 3 is another term for dǐ 砥 [HANYU DACIDIAN: vol. 3, pp. 1219; WANG 1993; 228]</p>
<p>5. Cuò 錯 refers to a whetstone, and the word occurs already in SHIJING; according to commentaries it was used in processing jades. [XIANG 1997: 93]</p>
<p>6. Cuò 厝 is a different term for cuò 錯. [HANYU DACIDIAN: vol. 1, pp. 926]</p>
<p>7. Lián (I have not found the character in a list): according to SHUOWEN red whetstone: HANYU DACIDIAN: vol. 7, pp. 1093]</p>
<p>8. Jiān 礛 was used in processing of jades. [HANYU DACIDIAN: vol. 7, pp. 1116]</p>
<p>9. Xíng 硎 refers to some kind of whetstone which was used to sharpen implements or to brush up jades. [HANYU DACIDIAN: vol. 7, pp. 1042]</p>
<p>NB: It is difficult to distinguish these terms which and attribute them to concrete archaeological finds; but it is quite probable that part of them, particularly lì 礪 and lì 厲 were quite simple implements like these illustrated in XIANG 1997: pp. 58, fig. 1, 2. Round grindstones or whetstones seems to be no older than the Warring States period (CHEN 1991: 199).</p>
