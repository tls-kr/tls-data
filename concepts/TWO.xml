<p>1. The general word is èr 二, a word which shows an extraordinary semantic and syntactic flexibility.</p>
<p>2. Liǎng 兩 is common when the reference is to a natural pair, but there are also many cases where the definite reference is merely to an aforementioned couple of items, and there are even a good number of cases where the reference is to any indefinite number of two things. Also the word regularly means "both the objects" when it precedes a transitive verb, and the word is never used as an ordinal number. Moreover, in complex numbers the word is not used.</p>
<p>3. O ㄆ偶 and ǒu 耦 refers to a man-made or artificial pair or pairing.</p>
<p>4. Zài 再 is mostly adverbial and refers to an action being performed twice.</p>
<p>5. Chóng 重 is mostly adnominal and refers to something being two-layered.</p>
<p>6. Bèi 倍 "double" refers to twice the amount of something.</p>

<p>1. The conventional idea that lia3ng 兩 must refer to natural pairs, repeated in WL, is not borne out by the facts.  Our analysis shows a wide variety of cases that are clear and neat exceptions to this traditional rule. </p>
<p>2. WL does not mention the important use of lia3ng 兩 as a dual object quantifier. Other unmentioned syntactic differences abound, and interestingly lia3ng 兩 cannot be used in classifier constructions. Indeed, most of the peculiarities of lia3ng 兩 are restrictions with respect to a wide range of current uses of e4r 二.</p>
