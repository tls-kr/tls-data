<p>2. Láo 勞 (ant. chéng 懲 "punish") focusses on the contribution by those who are being rewarded.</p>
<p>3. Kào 犒 focusses on the festive character of the ceremony accompanying or constituting the reward.</p>
<p>4. Bào 報 construes the reward as being an interaction between equals.</p>
<p>5. Cí 賜 refers to a present to an inferior in recognition of the latter's worth. For most examples see GIVE.</p>
<p>NB: The meaning of shǎng 賞 "give as a present" is post-Buddhist.</p>

<p>賜，賞</p>
<p>1. WL maintains that ci4 賜 simply means to give to an inferior 只表明為上之施予，不問有功無功. This is misleading, since ci4 賜 is often explicitly in recognition of personal moral merit, worth and desert, whereas sha3ng 賞 is directed at specific meritorious achievement.</p>
<p>HF 14.07:11; jiaoshi  224; jishi 249; jiaozhu 135; shiping 490</p>
<p>使民以功賞 they bring it about that people are rewarded for their achievements</p>
<p>   而不以仁義賜； but do not receive gratuitous gifts for moral excellence;</p>
<p>Occasionally, ci4 賜 is also in recognition of a meritorious action:</p>
<p>HF 30.32:01; jishi 551; jiaozhu 322; shiping 955</p>
<p>“有能徙此南門之外者， 毣s for the person who is able to shunt this thing outside the South Gate</p>
<p>10賜之上田、上宅。”</p>
<p>Rewards to others than the king's public servants are standardly called ci4 賜:</p>
<p>HF 32.10:01, jiaoshi 480; jishi 625; jiaozhu 370; shiping 1084 </p>
<p>宋王與齊仇也， The King of So4ng was on enemy terms with Q</p>
<p>築武宮。 and he built a military academy.</p>
<p>謳癸倡， Singer Gu led the singing</p>
<p>行者止觀， so that passers-by stopped to look</p>
<p>5築者不倦。 and the builders were untiring.</p>
<p>王聞， When the King heard about this </p>
<p>召而賜之。 he summoned the man and gave him presents.</p>
<p>In fact, even a senior minister could be rewarded in terms of ci4 賜 as reported by a senior minister who was given a fine vehicle:</p>
<p>HF 33.09:02; jiaoshi 527; jishi 679; shiping 1179; jiaozhu 411</p>
<p>曰： He said:</p>
<p>“君謀欲伐中山，   "The ruler is making plans and wants to launch a formal attack on Zho1ngsha1n.</p>
<p>10臣薦翟角 I have recommended D Jia3o</p>
<p>   而謀得果； and the plan achieved the desired result;</p>
<p>且伐之， when we were about to launch our formal attack</p>
<p>臣薦樂羊而中山拔； I recommended Yue4ya2ng and Zho1ngsha1n was taken.</p>
<p>得中山， when we had won Zho1ngsha1n</p>
<p>憂欲治之， we were worried and wanted to govern the place properly</p>
<p>15臣薦李克而中山治： so I recommended L Ke4, and Zho1ngsha1n was well-govverned.</p>
<p>是以君賜此車。” That is why the ruler has conferred on me this vehicle."</p>
<p/>
<p>Rewards and gifts are both regularly signs of appreciation, although there is the gratuitous gift of kindness: 慈惠之賜:</p>
<p>HF 45.05:10; jiaoshi 108; jishi 939; jiaozhu 615; shiping 1564; </p>
<p>賞賜， Rewards and presents</p>
<p>所以為重也； are ways to show one掇 deep regard for someone.</p>
