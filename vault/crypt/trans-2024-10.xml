Эта практика известна была и не одним китайцам (например, древним евреям). И то сказать, было бы весьма затруднительно обозначить каждую из них: столь разнородны и переплетены между собой афоризмы этой книги.Любопытнее всего заметить, что китайские школьники, заучивая наизусть и без всякого даже самого элементарного понимания эти главы, иногда и не подозревают о целом. Пишущий эти строки, попав летом 1912 г. в г. Фучжоу, отличающийся своим диалектом от северных больше, чем, например, различаются между собой русский и французский языки, был крайне удивлен, узнав от шестилетнего мальчугана, что он начал курс своих наук с «Кауи». Оказалось — по предъявлении самой книги, — что «Кауи» есть эта самая первая глава «Суждений и бесед», называемая по-пекински «Сюэ эр»! Точно так же случалось из беседы с погонщиком ослов узнавать о книге «Гао-цзы» — на самом же деле главе из книги мыслителя Мэн-цзы, называемой по первым словам первой ее статьи.</seg>

The remaining pieces seem to fit so well together and form such a coherent whole because they are quite typical of later epigonic Confucianist discourse: none of these pieces share any of the stylistic vivacity of style in much of the rest of the Analects. Nothing about this chapter seems remotely inspiring or philosophically important.  One is left wondering how this chapter got accepted as part of the Analects.</seg>

The remaining pieces seem to fit so well together and form such a coherent whole because they are quite typical of later epigonic Confucianist discourse: none of these pieces share any of the stylistic vivacity of style in much of the rest of the Analects. Little about this chapter seems remotely inspiring or philosophically important.  One is left wondering how this chapter got accepted as part of the Analects.</seg>

Yang Huo waited until Confucius was out, and then presented a steamed suckling pig at his home; Confucius waited until Yang Huo was out, and then went to pay his respects at the minister’s residence. One might ask: On this occasion, since Yang Huo had in fact first paid his respects to Confucius, how could Confucius have refused to go and see him?

This is a redo of the 15: Istory of a visit to Wei (with the same concluding verb sying fi "went his way"),upgraded to the more powerful Chi. The major new detail is the implicationthat Confucius should have been treated with the ceremonies due the head ofthe Ji; in other words, as a virtual head of state. The highest position previouslyclaimed for him was that of prime minister to the Prince of Lu, in 14:21.For a Mician expansion of this story, see MZ 4 7:3 (Mei Ethical 223).</seg>

Only at the end, when the hermit is found to have run away,do our sympathies turn. The parallel with 18:5 suggests an outside source,which (or an analogue of which; not all the Jwangdz has come down to us)may be JZ 25:6 (Watson Chuang 285f). The peroration, and thus the moral,is a more spelled-out version of the one in 18:6.The 18:5—7 series consists of what we may call a split pair, with 18:5 and18:7 parallel stories based on Jwangdz originals, separated (split) by a freelyinvented story on the same theme, but not as close to either of the flankingstories as they are to each other. This would suggest that the middle piece is aninterpolation, and in previous chapters such a situation has been so interpreted.We note, however, that once the ABA interpolated triplet (examples include3-4-6, with *3:5"* splitting a Lin Fang pair 3:4/6, or the very recent 17:4/6, onimproper offers, which are to be split by the self-interpolated * 17:58 passagegrouped with this chapter) has become familiar through memorization andrepetition, it is only a question of time before the ABA structure, like the AAstructure of the basic pairing pattern, comes to be seen as valid in its own right.We assume that this stage has been reached with this triplet, directly inspiredby Dz-shvn’s own prior interpolation of the ministerial * 17:5'8 between theanti-ministerial 17:4/6. It seems to us that the ABA framing structure here gives,and was meant to give, an architectural prominence to the central 18:6.】</seg>

For threeyears (0257-0255) he had been the oldest member and ex officio libationer atthe revived Ji-sya establishment in Chi, but his position there had becomedifficult, perhaps due to friction with colleagues representing earlier Chithought (SJ 74, Nienhauser Records 7/184). He thus moved to Lan-ling, andestablished a school that would last until his Chu patron died in 0238, andwould exert a profound influence on Confucianism well into the Han dynasty.Northern Lu was not occupied, but its affairs were effectively controlledfrom Lan-ling.

For three years (0257-0255) he had been the oldest member and ex officio libationer atthe revived Ji-sya establishment in Chi, but his position there had become difficult, perhaps due to friction with colleagues representing earlier Chithought (SJ 74, Nienhauser Records 7/184). He thus moved to Lan-ling, and established a school that would last until his Chu patron died in 0238, and would exert a profound influence on Confucianism well into the Han dynasty.Northern Lu was not occupied, but its affairs were effectively controlled from Lan-ling.

Itprobably seemed, at that time, that the loss of court influence was permanent.As the LY 15 interpolations show, Dz-jing had both scolded and encouragedthe members, but without improving their morale. Dz-gau came to the rescueby redefining the school and the Confucian enterprise, displacing the goal ofstate service on which its thoughts and efforts had previously been focused.In its place, the chapter offers what one might call a citizen ethic, whichholds that virtue is valuable even without public service. Learning (1:1, 1:4),the family (1:2, 1:6, 1:11), and the public worth off amily piety (1:2, 1:9) are itschief points; it is here that the value system noted by Lattimore Frontiers 398as postfeudal actually first appears. It was to be central, a millennium later, inthe emergence of neo-Confucianism. Here, however, it is all new, and thechapter begins by reassuring those to whom the new way must at first haveseemed insufficient and unsatisfying.LY | lacks thematic divisions; it is a single continuous dialogue betweenold and new ideas.

Schon der frühe Kommentator Bao Xian hattedie Minister, die in diesem Lied erwähnt werden, als die Nachfahren der beidenfrühen Dynastien identifiziert. Hinter dem Spruch Lunyu 3.8 mit seinemVerweis auf das Lied 57 steht, wie dargelegt, möglicherweise eine Stelle ausdem Kapitel «Liqi», in dem Konfuzius davon spricht, dass die Kenntnis aller300 Lieder nicht an eine einzige «Gabendarbietung» herankomme. Das Wort«Schmuck» (wen) bedeutet in Lunyu 1.6 «Bildung». Gemeint sein könnte diezeremonielle Bildung, die in den beiden Nachfolgestaaten nicht mehr vorhandenwar. An späterer Stelle (6.18) ist wen das, was auf den reinen Stoff zhiaufgetragen wird. Damit schließt 3.9 an 3.8 an.Im Kapitel «Liyun» («Die Umwälzungen der höflichen Regeln») der Aufzeichnungenzu den höflichen Regeln sagt Konfuzius, er sei nach Qi und Songgefahren, um dort etwas über die Regeln der Xia und der Shang zu erfahren,doch seien die Staaten nicht in der Lage gewesen, sie durchzuführen, ZhengXuan zufolge, weil ihre Fürsten nicht würdig genug waren.18 Der Satz ist dortalso noch einmal kürzer als in den Aufzeichnungen der Chronisten. Möglicherweiseist dies überhaupt die Ursprungsstelle. Auch das «Mitte und Einklang»-Kapitel enthält einen ähnlichen Hinweis auf die Nachfolge der Xia und derShang in Qi und Song.19 Dort sagt Konfuzius allerdings, dass er in Qi nicht inder Lage gewesen sei, eine solide Grundlage in Erfahrung zu bringen, währenddie Regeln der Yin in Song bewahrt seien. Er bekennt sich dann aber zudie acht reihen 155den Regeln der Zhou, was wiederum in Lunyu 3.14 aufgegriffen wird. Die Aufzeichnungenzu den höflichen Regeln enthalten offenbar eine komplexe Diskussionzur Haltung des Konfuzius zu den alten Dynastien, die in den Gesprächenzusammengefasst ist.20</seg>

Дао-Путъ Конфуция отличается от дао-Пути Лао-цзы именно противопоставлением «истинно человеческого» служения людям химерическому «истинно человеческому» удалению от людей в астральное отвлечение. Для Конфуция дао-Путь есть начало, органически развивающееся в душе из обыденных, хотя и высоких самих по себе явлений, как, например, здесь из семейной субординации; и следовательно, смысл фразы тот, что дао-Путь рождается только из корней, каковыми, например, могут быть корни «истинно человеческого», а это последнее и есть дао-Путъ — основной идеал проповеди Конфуция.]</seg>

The meaning is quite clear in the historical context.  Confucius admires the intrepid and unselfish 忠 "doing one's unstinting loyal best (for one's)" by Níng, who did ultimately assure the reinstalment of the incompetent ruler to whom he owed his loyalty. It is important for this story that Níng was not seeking employment when the way did not prevail: he is here takent to have loyally continued the service he owed. However the historical facts may have to interpreted in the end, it is clear the Confucius was philosophising about the changing public renommé of Níng, not any changing prudential competence.  The philosophical point deserves close analysis.　The reception history of this also.】</seg>

Da es viele historische Beziehungen hat, ist die Durcharbeitung des Stoffes nicht immer leicht. Umgekehrt gibt es dem aufmerksamen Beobachter vielen Stoff für die richtige Einordnung Kungs in den historischen Verlauf des chinesischen Geisteslebens. Der in dem Buch wiederholt ausgesprochene Gedanke ist, daß alle äußere Form nur dann Sinn hat, wenn ihr ein adäquater Inhalt zur Seite steht. So müssen auch alle Riten und Religionsbräuche Ausfluß der entsprechenden religiösen Gesinnung sein, wenn sie Wert haben sollen. Im übrigen wenden sich die einzelnen Abschnitte gegen Luxus, Anmaßung und Überfeinerung der Zeit und weisen auf die Einfachheit und Strenge des Altertums als Vorbild.”Excerpt FromGesprächeKonfuziushttps://itunes.apple.com/WebObjects/MZStore.woa/wa/viewBook?id=0This material may be protected by copyright.</seg>

Der Begriff hängt zusammen mit dem Begriff »jen« »Mensch«, ja der Begriff »Mensch« wird in dem Werk »Dschung Yung« direkt zur Erklärung herangezogen. Gewöhnlich wird das Wort übersetzt mit »Menschlichkeit«, »Humanität«, »Wohlwollen«, »Vollkommenheit«. Es sind das alles Übersetzungen, die möglich sind nach vorausgegangener Definition. »Menschlichkeit« hat aber eine etwas andre Klangfarbe, ebenso »Humanität«, deshalb haben wir, um einen möglichst umfassenden Begriff zu geben, den Ausdruck »sittlich«, »Sittlichkeit« gewählt. Es liegt darin das »sozial Bedingte, das mit der weiteren Entwicklung sich erweitert zum Ideal der gerecht-liebevollen Behandlung der Nebenmenschen im Sinn der möglichsten Förderung der Menschheit im eigenen und fremden Ich« (vgl.

Itprobably seemed, at that time, that the loss of court influence was permanent.As the LY 15 interpolations show, Dz-jing had both scolded and encouragedthe members, but without improving their morale. Dz-gau came to the rescueby redefining the school and the Confucian enterprise, displacing the goal ofstate service on which its thoughts and efforts had previously been focused.In its place, the chapter offers what one might call a citizen ethic, which holds that virtue is valuable even without public service. Learning (1:1, 1:4),the family (1:2, 1:6, 1:11), and the public worth of family piety (1:2, 1:9) are itschief points; it is here that the value system noted by Lattimore Frontiers 398as postfeudal actually first appears. It was to be central, a millennium later, inthe emergence of neo-Confucianism. Here, however, it is all new, and thechapter begins by reassuring those to whom the new way must at first have seemed insufficient and unsatisfying.LY | lacks thematic divisions; it is a single continuous dialogue between old and new ideas.
