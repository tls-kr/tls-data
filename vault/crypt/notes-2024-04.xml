<p>1. The general all-purpose pre-verbal negation is 不.</p>
<p>2. Fēi 非 "by no means" negates judgments and is therefore typically pre-nominal, although the negation is also current in judgmental verbal sentences.</p>
<p>3. Wú 無 "in no way; in no way i.e. regarding no object", when used as a straight negation (contrast SHOULD NOT) is generalising and not straightforwardly narrative or descriptive.</p>
<p>4. Fú 弗 "would not; could not" prototypically refers to a refusal or inability to do something which in principle one might intend to do.</p>
<p>5. Wèi 未 "not yet; not quite" refers to either temporal or logical incompleteness in verbal predication, and there seem to be no cases where the predication is by a nominal expression.</p>
<p>6. Fǒu 否 "It is not the case" is a negative pro-form, and there remains a suspicion that the graph 不 is to be read as fǒu 否 when it is used as a pro-form.</p>
<p>7. Mò 莫 "none is always resumptive of an explicit or implicit subject.</p>
<p>8. Wú 毋 and wù 勿 when not used injunctively, are negations restricted to the position after such causative verbs as 使.</p>
