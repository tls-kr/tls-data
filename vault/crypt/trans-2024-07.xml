King Wei of Qi set up a great cauldron in the courtyard and repeatedly scolded Wu Yan, saying, "Your praises reach my ears daily. But observing your deeds, the fields are overgrown, the granaries are empty, and the prisons are full. You have deceived me with treacherous affairs." He then had Wu Yan boiled alive. For thirty-two years after this, nothing was left unclaimed on the roads of Qi. This is an example of punishment being minimal yet effectively deterring crime. Duke Mu of Qin went on an excursion and his carriage broke down, losing the right horse. A peasant found it. Duke Mu pursued him and caught up on the sunny side of Mount Qi, where he saw the peasant slaughtering and eating the horse. Duke Mu said, "Eating the meat of a fine horse without drinking wine afterward is harmful. I fear it will harm you." He then offered them all drinks before leaving. A year later, in the battle of Han against Duke Hui of Jin, Jin troops surrounded Duke Mu's chariot, and Liang Youmi grabbed the reins, about to capture him.

Thus, by rewarding one person, the entire realm praises him, and by punishing one person, the entire realm fears him. Hence, the greatest rewards are not wasteful, and the greatest punishments are not excessive. Confucius executed Shao Zhengmao, and the evil in the state of Lu was stopped. Zichan executed Deng Xi, and the wickedness in the state of Zheng was prohibited. From the near, one can infer the far; from the small, one can know the great.
