<p>[[COMMON/RARE]]</p>
<p>[OBJECT-BINDING/SUBJECT-BINDING]</p>
<p>1. Jiē 皆 the most common and general colourless subject qunatifier which is also used, occasionally as an object quantifier.</p>
<p>SUBJECT-BINDING!; [padV]</p>
<p>2.Jìn 盡 is a universal object quantifier which indicates that the action the transitive verb it precedes applies to the whole lot of the objects of that verb indiscriminately.</p>
<p>[OBJECT-BINDING!], [COLLECTIVE]; [vadVt]</p>
<p>3. Gè 各 quantifies by emphasising the separate features of each item quantiified over.</p>
<p>[INDIVIDUAL], [SUBJECT-BINDING]; [n+Vt]</p>
<p>4. Jiān 兼 is an object quantifier which says that the transitive verb it precedes applies to each of the objects in its own right.</p>
<p>[OBJECT-BINDING], [INDIVIDUAL]; [vadVt]</p>

<p>[COLLECTIVE]; [nadN]</p>

<p>[COLLECTIVE]; [nadN]</p>
<p>8. Fán 凡 characterises a topic adnominally as forming the general subject or topic in a non-narrative statement of principle. The current gloss "in general" is misleading because it wrongly suggests that there are exceptions, and because it does not specify the non-narrative "theoretical" nature of the statements introduced by the word. "In principle" is much to be preferred.</p>
<p>[SPECIFIC]; [vadN[TOPIC]]</p>
<p>9. Jù 俱 / 具 is a collective subject quantifier which says that all the subjects are equally and together characterised by what is in the predicate.</p>
<p>[SUBJECT-BINDING]; [vadV]</p>

<p>[COLLECTIVE], [OBJECT-BINDING]; [padVt]</p>
<p>12. Měi 每 mostly adnominal and emphasises that a each and every new item quantified over is separately intended.</p>
<p>[INDIVIDUAL]; [padN]</p>
<p>13. Jūn 均 / 鈞 expresses universal quantification over all subjects equally, without any difference.</p>
<p>[INDIVIDUAL], [SUBJECT-BINDING]; [vadN]</p>
