And in the second place, very clearly, the elder brother was entitled to lord it over his own son.　3. According to the virtue 悌 Confucius should have obeyed his elder (or indeed: eldest) brother 兄 on all matters, and certainly in a matter like this.   4. One would like to know why Confucius was able to openly dispose of his brother's daughter, and why, secondly, he could be specifically commended for this.   It will be good to trace the rich Korean and Japanese sources of this kind of issue. See 竹添光鸿撰《論語會箋》.   5.  This is a neat example of how the composition of the Analects, where many pieces form pairs, some even series with more or less loose associative connections.  In this case we have a pair of marriage arrangements by the master, both of which predominantly of biographic rather than narrowly philosophical concern.</seg>

The metaphor of going to court against oneself in one's mind is philosophically revolutionary, and certainly not to be expected.  5. The 過 in this context are moral transgressions rather than argumentative or logical mistakes: it is important to stress this before one goes on to discuss this extraordinary piece.  6. The philosopher becomes an object unto himself, in this piece: the self as another that one can blame.     7. The history of such argumentative self-reflexivity in ancient China begins with this piece.  This history has to be traced carefully.   8. It will also be well worthwhile, quite separately, to study the reception history of this piece right down to the twentieth century in some detail in order to see to what extent such moral reflexivity gained support through Chinese intellectual history, and to what extent its intellectual importance was recognised by commentators down to the present. 】</seg>

So einer werde in den gegenwärtigen Zeitläuften kaum mit dem Leben davonkommen, so konstatiert der traditionelle Kommentar. Wir lesen vom Priester Tuo in einem Eintrag aus dem vierten Jahrdes Herzogs Ding (506 v. Chr.). Er macht den Herzog Ling von Wei (540–493 v. Chr.) mit seiner Rede zum Vorsitzenden eines Eidbundes, in dem er sehr gewandt mit historischen Kenntnissen zeigt, dass andere Staaten diesem Vorsitz nicht gewachsen sind, und er sichert dem Herzog eine lange Herrschaft.38 Auch Zizhao ist aus dem Umfeld des Herzogs Ling von Wei bekannt. Nanzi, die Gattin des Herzogs Ling, bittet ihren Mann, ihn aus Song kommenzu lassen. Sie soll eine Tochter aus dem Haus von Song gewesen sein und Zizhao ein Prinz aus diesem Haus. Aus dieser Zeit datiert eine sexuelle Beziehung der beiden. Sie lässt ihn 496 v. Chr. rufen, um diese Beziehung wieder aufleben zu lassen.39 Als der Kronprinz Kuaikui für ein diplomatisches Abkommen durch Song reist, hört er auf dem Lande einen Bauern singen: «Wo Eure Sau jetzt befriedigt ist, könnt Ihr uns unseren Eber doch zurückschicken!» Der Kronprinz versinkt im Erdboden vor Scham. Er plant,Nanzi, die der Text als seine Mutter bezeichnet, umzubringen. Das Komplott missglückt, und der Kronprinz flieht ausgerechnet nach Song, in die Heimat des Zizhao, zieht aber von dort aus weiter nach Jin, der damaligen der ausgewogene!  Dies alles geschieht zufällig in dem Jahr, in dem Konfuzius Lu verlässt.Die «Redegewandtheit» steht in den Gesprächen sonst nicht hoch im Kurs. Dass Priester Tuo dafür gelobt wird, ist auch eine Bankrotterklärung der konfuzianischen Werte.40 In dieser Zeit war offenbar mit anständigen Tugenden nicht weit zu kommen. Für 6.16 ist wichtig, dass Prinz Zhao bzw. Zizhao im Zuozhuan noch ein weiteres Mal auftaucht. Im elften Jahr des Herzogs Ai (484 v. Chr., also zwölf Jahre später) folgt direkt auf den für 6.15 wichtigen Bericht über die Schlacht von Lu gegen Qi die für Lunyu 5.16 schon zusammengefasste Geschichte von Shishu Qi, dem Mann aus Wei, der die Tochtereben dieses Zizhao geheiratet hatte. Als Zizhao Wei verließ, um nach Song heimzukehren,41 befahl der mit dem exilierten Kronprinzen verschwägerte Wei-Minister Kong Yu (Wenzi) dem Shishu Qi, sich von dieser Frau scheiden zu lassen. Stattdessen gab er ihm seine eigene Tochter zur Frau, offenbar um die Fraktion des Kronprinzen in Wei zu stärken. Der Leser kann nur ahnen, wer die erste Frau dieses Shishu Qi war. Nicht ganz ausgeschlossen ist, dass sie eine Tochter des Zizhao und der Nanzi sein könnte. Shishu Qi hielt aberzu seiner ersten Frau und deren jüngerer Schwester und ging nach Song – wo Zizhao, der Vater der beiden jungen Frauen, weilte. Er wird dort ein Partnerdes Xiang Tui bzw. Huan Tui, der dem Konfuzius einmal nach dem Leben trachtet (Lunyu 7.23). Zizhao gehört aufgrund seines Familienhintergrunds der Parteiung an, die gegen den Kronprinzen Kuaikui eingestellt ist. Man sollte 6.16 als einen Kommentar zur Thronfolgediskussion in Wei lesen: In Herzog Lings Zeitenkonnte ein Zizhao mit all seiner Liederlichkeit noch durchkommen – oder: Herzog Ling hatte einen Priester Tuo und konnte sich die Eskapade mit dem Liebhaber seiner Frau noch leisten. Er starb eines natürlichen Todes. Aber in der Gegenwart wird die Parteiung, die Nanzi und Zizhao in Wei installiert hat, nicht überleben. Das ist eine versteckte Warnung an die Konfuzius-Schüler, sich nicht auf Wei einzulassen. Bekanntermaßen begab sich Zilu nach Wei, um dort Dienst zu tun. Er kam dort im fünfzehnten Jahr des Herzogs Ai um – auch er also ein Beispiel für einen Konfuzius-Schüler, der ein Amt besser nicht angenommen hätte.】</seg>

Ursprünglich bedeutet es einfach ein «Geschenk», das man als Zeichen der Verbundenheit und der bedingungslosen Treue überreichte. Im schon oft zitierten «Standard»-Kapitel der Aufzeichnungen der höflichen Regeln finden wir den interessanten Satz: «Innerer Kern war bei Shun und der Xia-Dynastie, Bildung bei den Yin / Shang und den Zhou am höchsten. Bei den Xia bezwang die Bildung nicht den inneren Kern, und bei den Yin und Zhou der innere Kern nicht die Bildung.» Dasselbe Kapitel spricht wenig zuvor unter Berufung auf Konfuzius davon, dassder Weg der Xia viele Vorteile hatte, unter anderem den der Treue. Der Nachteil aber war «Rohheit» und ein Mangel an Bildung oder Kultiviertheit. Dann folgen Ausführungen über die Yin / Shang, die nicht von direktem Belang sind, bevor es über die Zhou heißt, dass sie den Geistern gegenüber achtsam waren, sie aber von sich fernhielten (Lunyu 6.22), wobei ihr Nachteildie Gewinnsucht und die Gewandtheit (Lunyu 1.3) gewesen seien.43 Ehrerbietigkeit,bei der kein Einklang mit den höflichen Regeln bestehe, sei «Rohheit», so sagt Konfuzius im ersten Satz des Kapitels «Zhongni lebte in Muße»aus dem Liji. Das sieht nach dem Fundus aus, der für 6.18 herangezogen wurde. Viel wichtiger ist, dass in 13.3 Konfuzius über Zilu sagt, er sei «roh» gewesen– und zwar im Zusammenhang mit der Diskussion der Frage, wie im Staat Wei richtig vorzugehen sei. Die Richtigstellung der Bezeichnungen seider entscheidende Punkt. Zilu hält dies für abwegig, und Konfuzius weist ihn dafür hart zurecht. Wie 6.16 und 6.17 dürfte auch 6.18 in den Zusammenhangeiner Diskussion der Qualitäten des Zilu und seines Versagens in Weigehören, die mit seinem Mangel an Verfeinerung zu tun hatten. Zilu weist die Tugenden der mit der Xia-Dynastie assoziierten guten inneren Eigenschaftenauf: Er ist überaus loyal und anständig, aber «roh» und ungehobelt, wie das seine Biographie in den Aufzeichnungen der Chronisten eingangs über ihn sagt und wie auch aus Lunyu 11.15 hervorgeht, wo es heißt, dass die anderen Schüler nichts mit ihm zu tun haben wollten. Der Satz 6.18 schließt, wie im Kommentar zu 6.2 gezeigt, in den Äußeren Überlieferungen des Han Ying zu278 6 Konfuzius-schüler und die politikden Liedern direkt an 6.1 und 6.2 an. Er ist der theoretische Überbau für die praktische Kritik an der zu großen Einfachheit des Zisang Bozi. Dieser wiederum könnte als ein alter ego des Zilu zu sehen sein. Mit dieser Einfachheit und mangelnden Ausbildung vom Lernen auf die Politik umzuschalten, das war gefährlich.Sima Qian zitiert in seiner Bewertung des Han-Gründers Liu Bang dieselben Stellen, die auch hinter Lunyu 6.18 stehen. Er legt damit nahe, dass Liu Bang an derselben Krankheit litt wie Zilu, nämlich einer erheblichen Ungeschliffenheit,die schließlich zum politischen Versagen auf mehreren Ebenenführte.44 Die Umstandskrämerei dürfte der Nachteil anderer Schüler gewesen sein. Zu ihr sagt ein an das Kapitel «Besuchsregeln» des Ritenklassikers Yili angehängter Notizenteil: «Wenn der Worte zu viel sind, so führt das zur Umstandskrämer Die Überlegungen in den nächsten Sprüchen setzen sich mit dem Themader rechten Ausgewogenheit auseinander.6.19】</seg>
