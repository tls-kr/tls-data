And in the second place, very clearly, the elder brother was entitled to lord it over his own son.　3. According to the virtue 悌 Confucius should have obeyed his elder (or indeed: eldest) brother 兄 on all matters, and certainly in a matter like this.   4. One would like to know why Confucius was able to openly dispose of his brother's daughter, and why, secondly, he could be specifically commended for this.   It will be good to trace the rich Korean and Japanese sources of this kind of issue. See 竹添光鸿撰《論語會箋》.   5.  This is a neat example of how the composition of the Analects, where many pieces form pairs, some even series with more or less loose associative connections.  In this case we have a pair of marriage arrangements by the master, both of which predominantly of biographic rather than narrowly philosophical concern.</seg>
