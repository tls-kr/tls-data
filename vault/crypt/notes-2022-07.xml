<p>1. The notion of hospitality to strangers in need and to travellers passing through which is so important in ancient Greece is not as prominent in China as it was in Greece. The closest one can come is hòu 厚 "meet with polite respect and generous hospitality" (ant. báo 薄 "fail to treat with generous hospitality and proper respect").</p>
<p>2. Lǐ 禮 "show polite respect to" (ant. màn 慢 "treat without proper respect") refers to ritualised respect which is the Chinese Way of hospitality and does connote conviviality. See also RESPECT.</p>

<p>1. The current general term for salient features and principles of charismatic moral integrity and generosity is dé 德, when used as a term of ethical evalutation; but this word has many other philosophically important meanings.</p>
<p>2. Other general terms for subjectively construed general moral commendation include měi 美 "point of moral distinction" (ant. è 惡 "point of moral decrepitude"), and occasionally gāo 高 "elevated points, elevated spirit" (ant. jiàn 賤 "point of vulgar decrepitude"). NB that shàn 善 "excellent" is not used as a general term of positive moral appreciation in pre-Buddhist texts.</p>
<p>3. The most current dé 德 "virtues" recognised in pre-Buddhist China are rén 仁 "kind-heartedness", yì 義 "rectitude", lǐ 禮 "propriety", zhì 智 "wisdom", and xìn 信 "good faith".</p>
<p>4. Further important virtues are xiào 孝 "filial piety", zhōng 忠 "loyal diligence", tì 悌 / 弟 "brotherly affection", lián 廉 "impeccable probity", jié 節 "moderation", and perhaps yǒng 勇 "the courage of one's moral convictions". ( 說苑 : 百行 (xìng) 孝為先 )</p>
<p>5. Zhōng yōng 中庸 "the mean in action" may be mentioned as a a central Confucian virtue, jiān ài 兼愛 "unIversal love" as a Mohist virtue, wú wéi 無為 "unobtrusive action" as a non-moralistic Taoist virtue.</p>

<p>1. The most current general marker of the passive is jiàn 見 which means literally "be exposed to, face".</p>
<p>2. Wéi 為 and yú 於 are structural particles which abstractly indicate that certain verbs in their environment are passive.</p>
<p>3. Bèi 被 typically refers to the suffering of something undesirable.</p>
<p>4. Qǔ 取 typically refers to the suffering of something undesirable by one's own fault.</p>
<p>5. Zāo 遭 and yù 遇 refer to running into what tend to be undesirable situations.</p>
<p>6. Shòu 受 refers to an agent being the recipient of some impact from the outside.</p>
<p>NB: Note that the notion of the passive is notoriously ill-defined for a language like classical Chinese, and what some grammarians view as passive constructions will be construed by others as periphrastic ways of expressing with various transitive verbs and prepositions what other other languages express with passive forms.</p>
