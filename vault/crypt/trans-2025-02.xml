At this point, if the Sixth Ancestor is that person, he should make concentrated effort on the words “no buddha nature.”@1-61-123 Leaving aside the “have no” of “having” or “having no,” he should ask, “What is it that is buddha nature?”@1-61-124 He should inquire, “What thing is it that is buddha nature?” People today as well, once they have heard “buddha nature,” without going on to ask what it is that is buddha nature, seem to talk about the meaning of having and not having of buddha nature. This is precipitate.

The time of birth is “has buddha nature,” is “has no buddha nature”; the time of death is also “has buddha nature,” is “has no buddha nature.” If we discuss the dispersal and non-dispersal of the wind and fire, it would be the dispersal and non-dispersal of buddha nature. The time that it disperses must be buddha nature existing, must be buddha nature not existing; the time that it has not dispersed must be “having buddha nature,” must be “having no buddha nature.”@1-103-324 Despite this, to cling mistakenly to [the views that] buddha nature is present or not present depending on whether something is moving or not moving, or it is spirit or is not spirit depending on whether something is conscious or not conscious, or it is the nature or is not the nature depending on whether something is knowing or not knowing — these are other paths. “From beginningless kalpas,” that “the deluded,” “acknowledging the knowing spirit,” have taken it as buddha nature, have taken it as “the original person” — what a laugh!@1-103-325To say something further about buddha nature, although we need not be dragged through the mud and drenched with water, it is “fences, walls, tiles, and pebbles.”@1-103-326 When we say something beyond this, what is buddha nature?
