Kongzi’s disciple Zengzi suggests that it is one of the two most important aspects of the Confucian Way (4.15).2 Zhu Xi thinks verses 7A4.2 and 3 describe two different states of ethical development: “If one turns toward oneself and is Genuine, one is already benevolent. But if one is not Genuine,there are still selfish thoughts interfering, and the Pattern is not pure.Hence, in all activities one should force oneself to extend (one’s sympathies)to others. When one is close to the general Pattern, benevolence is not far away.”]</seg>

Of the six occurrences of the word in this passage,the first seems to mean aspiration (see the following quote from theXun Zi), the middle four are commonly taken as “know” or “knowledge”(although the Dingzhou text has all six written as zhi 智). The last onecan be read either as “knowledge” or “wisdom,” but (again given the quotefrom the Xun Zi) it seems better to be taken as wisdom.The Master’s remark reminds us of Socrates’ “knowing one’s own ignoranceis wisdom,” and Lao Zi’s “To know that you don’t know is knowledge/wisdom. To say that you know when you don’t know is an illness” (Lao Zi,chap. 71). While ordinarily people think that the more one learns the moreone knows, interestingly and paradoxically, the more one learns the moreone realizes how much one does not know. But there is more in Confucius’teaching than simply knowing one’s ignorance—it is also an attitude towardlife, as is illustrated in a fuller account of the story in the Xun Zi:Zilu dressed in fancy clothes when he came to see Confucius.Confucius said, “You [Zilu], what is the reason for the fanciness?Early on, when the Yangtze emerges from Mount Min, at itsorigin its flow is barely enough to overflow a goblet. But whenit reaches the crossing point, then without tying together boatsand avoiding the winds, you would not be able to cross it. Isthis not simply because of the vast amount of water flowingdown?

Of the six occurrences of the word in this passage, the first seems to mean aspiration (see the following quote from theXun Zi), the middle four are commonly taken as “know” or “knowledge” (although the Dingzhou text has all six written as zhi 智). The last one can be read either as “knowledge” or “wisdom,” but (again given the quote from the Xun Zi) it seems better to be taken as wisdom.The Master’s remark reminds us of Socrates’ “knowing one’s own ignorance is wisdom,” and Lao Zi’s “To know that you don’t know is knowledge/wisdom. To say that you know when you don’t know is an illness” (Lao Zi,chap. 71). While ordinarily people think that the more one learns the more one knows, interestingly and paradoxically, the more one learns the more one realizes how much one does not know. But there is more in Confucius’ teaching than simply knowing one’s ignorance—it is also an attitude toward life, as is illustrated in a fuller account of the story in the Xun Zi:Zilu dressed in fancy clothes when he came to see Confucius. Confucius said, “You [Zilu], what is the reason for the fanciness?Early on, when the Yangtze emerges from Mount Min, at its origin its flow is barely enough to overflow a goblet. But when it reaches the crossing point, then without tying together boats and avoiding the winds, you would not be able to cross it. Is this not simply because of the vast amount of water flowing own? Now your clothes are fancy and your countenance is puffed up. Who in the world would be willing to remonstrate with you like this?”</seg>

[Zhu Xi explains this difficult passageas follows: “Gaozi said that if there is something that onedoes not understand in doctrines, then one should set thedoctrine aside and need not examine and search for thePattern in one’s heart. If one is not at peace in one’s heart,then one should regulate one’s {38} heart with force andneed not further seek for help from the qi. This is the wayin which he firmly maintained his heart and quicklybecame unperturbed. Having recited Gaozi’s doctrines,Mengzi passes judgment on them: When Gaozi says thatwhat you do not get from your heart you should not seekfor in the qi, this is being concerned about the root andrelaxed about the branches—that is acceptable. When hesays that what you do not get from doctrines you shouldnot seek from the heart, then he is already lost due toexternal things, and so has left behind what is internal.This is necessarily unacceptable.”David S. Nivison offered an alternative interpretation,based on a parallel between this passage and Zhuangzi’sfictional dialogue between “Kongzi” and “Yan Hui”:Gaozi recommends that we completely commit ourselvesto following correct ethical doctrines, forcing our heartand our qi to follow what they dictate. In contrast, Mengzirecommends that we not only follow ethical doctrines butseek further to find the basis for these doctrines in thereactions of our heart (2A6, 6A10), which will then guideour qi. Finally, Zhuangzi recommends that we ultimatelyeschew doctrines, empty our hearts, and follow thepromptings of the qi, which unites us with other things.5]</seg>

Nonetheless, if that which the qi rests in isunified, then the will, on the contrary, will be moved by it.For example, if someone is running and stumbling, the qi isfocused on this and it will, on the contrary, move the will.This is why one must both maintain one’s will but also notinjure the qi.”][2.11] Gongsun Chou next asked, “May I ask wherein youexcel, Master?” Mengzi replied, “I understand doctrines.

[Zhu Xi explains, “This verse means that ifpeople can nurture this qi to completion, then their qi willharmonize with the Way and righteousness and assistthem, so that, in one’s actions, one will have a courageand resoluteness that lacks any doubts or fears. Withoutthis qi, then even if one’s actions do not necessarilydiverge from the Way and righteousness, nonetheless one’sbody will not be filled with qi, so that one cannot avoiddoubts and fears, and one will be unable to be effective.”][2.15] It is produced by accumulated righteousness. It cannotbe obtained by a seizure of righteousness. If some of one’sactions leave one’s heart unsatisfied, it will starve.Consequently, I say that Gaozi never understoodrighteousness, because he regarded it as external. [Zhu Xiexplains, “This means that, although qi can harmonizewith the Way and righteousness, the beginning ofnurturing it is to have every action accord withrighteousness. If one examines oneself and is constantly{40} upright, one will be ashamed of nothing, and this qiwill naturally be produced from within. One cannot doonly a single action that accidentally accords withrighteousness and then get it by a ‘seizure’ of what isexternal. ‘If some of one’s actions leave one’s heartunsatisfied, it will starve’ means that as soon as what onedoes is not in accord with righteousness and one examinesoneself and is not upright, then there will be aninadequacy in one’s heart, and one’s body will not befilled. This being the case, how could righteousness beexternal? Gaozi did not understand the Pattern of this, sohe said, ‘Benevolence is internal,’ ‘righteousness isexternal’ (6A4–5), and because he did not regardbecoming righteous as a task, he was necessarily unable toaccumulate righteousness in order to produce thefloodlike qi. The earlier verse, ‘What you do not get fromdoctrines, do not seek for in your heart’ (2A2.9a), isprecisely the meaning of treating righteousness asexternal.”]</seg>

If one examines oneself and is constantly{40} upright, one will be ashamed of nothing, and this qiwill naturally be produced from within. One cannot doonly a single action that accidentally accords withrighteousness and then get it by a ‘seizure’ of what isexternal. ‘If some of one’s actions leave one’s heartunsatisfied, it will starve’ means that as soon as what onedoes is not in accord with righteousness and one examinesoneself and is not upright, then there will be aninadequacy in one’s heart, and one’s body will not befilled. This being the case, how could righteousness beexternal? Gaozi did not understand the Pattern of this, sohe said, ‘Benevolence is internal,’ ‘righteousness isexternal’ (6A4–5), and because he did not regardbecoming righteous as a task, he was necessarily unable toaccumulate righteousness in order to produce thefloodlike qi. The earlier verse, ‘What you do not get fromdoctrines, do not seek for in your heart’ (2A2.9a), isprecisely the meaning of treating righteousness asexternal.”]</seg>

Those who pull on them and ‘help’ them to grow assume they have it, and when they do not get it,they act recklessly. If one does not weed, then one willonly fail to nurture it, but if one pulls on it, then one will,on the contrary, harm it. If one avoids these two things,then one’s qi will be nurtured and will not be injured. Iflike Gaozi one is unable to {41} accumulate righteousnessbut desires to force one’s heart to be regulated, then onewill be unable to avoid the twin faults of assuming andassisting. Not only will he not be good at cultivating the‘floodlike,’ but he will even harm it.”Iris Murdoch makes a similar point: “Self-knowledge willlead us to avoid occasions of temptation rather than torely on naked strength to overcome them. We must notarrogate to ourselves actions which belong to those whose spiritual vision is higher or other than ours. From thisattempt, only disaster will come.” In short, “One must perform the lower act which one can manage and sustain: not the higher act that one bungles.”6]</seg>

She lived in a mountain temple at Heguri 平群, and, organizing a devotees' association, painted a Buddha image with a picture of the six existences in order to give thanks for the four kinds of blessings. When completed, it was enshrined in the temple after the dedication ceremony. Meanwhile she left the temple, going from place to place on errands. During that time the picture was stolen, and she looked forit in vain, crying pitifully. Still leading the devotees' organization, she wanted to free living beings, and the members went to Naniwa 難波 to visit the market. When they saw a basket in a tree, they heard various animals crying in the basket. They waited for the owner to return, for they thought there must be animals in the basket and they wanted to buy them and set them free. Meanwhile, the owner returned. When they said to him, "We heard some animals in yourbasket, and we have been waiting to buy them from you," the owner said, "No, there is nothing alive in it." The nun did not give up, however. She continued begging till the merchants around them said to the owner, "You should open the basket." The owner was frightened, and he ran away, leaving the basket. When they opened it, they discovered the stolen image. In joy and tears the devotees cried, "Since we lost this image, we have been longing for it day and night. Now, by chance, we have found it. How happy we are!" When the merchants heard this, they gathered around and praised the nun's perseverance.</seg>

C. Graham explains, in Mengzi’s era, qi“is like such words in other cultures as Greek pneuma‘wind, air, breath.’ It is the energetic fluid which vitalisesthe body, in particular as the breath, and which circulates outside us as the air.” Later, this concept is “adapted to cosmology as the universal fluid … out of which all things condense and into which they dissolve.”3 (This late sense is how thinkers like Zhu Xi understood it.) Qi is thus the physical medium through which one’s emotions and personal character are manifested. So to “preserve one’s qi” is to control one’s emotions. Meng Shishe was similarto Zengzi in that both focused on something inside themselves, as opposed to Bogong You and Zixia, who focused on something external to themselves. However, as Zhu Xi explains, “what Meng Shishe preserved was just the qi of one’s self. This is not as good as Zengzi’s examining himself and following the Pattern (of the Way).He preserved what is especially important. Mengzi’s unperturbed heart has its source in this.”4]</seg>

Чжао Ци. Реплика Мэнцзы состоит из антитезы двух развернутых метафор и вывода, разъяс-няющего уже прямо, без тропов, их значение. В основе здесь та мысль, что слава че-ловека органически связана с проявлением им своей природы, которая заключаетсяво врожденной доброте (см. вводн. коммент. к 3.2). Источник, дотекающий до мо-рей — границ ойкумены — подразумевает человеческую природу и ее всеохваты-вающую актуализацию (ср. 3.6), а скопление дождевой воды — тип действий, обу-словленный не этим началом, а внешними обстоятельствами. Те же образы соответ-ственно ассоциируются со славой, вечной и эфемерной. «[Естественное] состояние»цин 情 указывает именно на такую существенную актуализацию. Поскольку онаскладывается из последовательного ряда ступеней (см. 14.25), то благородный муж,т.е. тот, кто посвятил себя самореализации, озабочен тем, чтобы величина его славы,моральный престиж полностью им соответствовали.</seg>

So even in thecase of what is in man, can we possibly say that he does notcontain a heart*and-mind marked with manhood-at-its-bestand propriety? The way in which he lays aside his heartand-mind in its excellent state may be compared to the wayin which hatchets and axes have treated trees. How can thebeauty remain when they are cut day after day? But then tooin the case of men's hearts-and-minds there occurs an increaseof growth both day and night which we recognizeas the air of dawn and whose likes and dishkes are quitesimilar among all men. But then what is done all day longputs this good air in shackles or destroys it. If it is shackledrepeatedly, that air which can accumulate overnight cannotbe maintained; and in that case man finds himself not farremoved from the condition of birds and beasts.

As his mother's mind was set on doing good, he said to her, "There will be a great meeting for a week's lecture on the Hoke-kyō XXX in the eastern mountain. Shall we go to hear the teaching?" His mother, deceived, was eager to go, and, devoutly purifying herself in a hot bath, accompanied her son to the mountain. Then he looked at her fiercely, as though with the eyes of a bull, and said, "You, kneel down on the ground!" Gazing at his face, she said, "Why are you talking like that? Are you possessed by a fiend?" The son, however, drew a sword to kill her. Kneeling down in front of her son, she said to him, "We plant a tree in order to get its fruit and to take shelter in its shade. We bring up children in order to get their help and to depend on them.

One pile goes to you, my eldest son, one to my second son, and one to my third son." When the wicked son stepped forward to cut off his mother's head, the earth opened to swallow him. At that moment his mother grabbed her falling son by the hair and appealed to Heaven, wailing, "My child is possessed by some spirit and driven to such an evil deed. He is out of his mind. I beseech you to forgive his sin." In spite of all her efforts to pull him up by the hair, he fell down.

Under such circumstances, if aperson begins to act arrogantly and resort to force, it isinevitable that he will be punished by the law of executers.Hence, a sage can accord with both Yin and Yang, andbecome weak as well as strong, react according to the everchangingsituation, and make contributions on the basis of histalents.
