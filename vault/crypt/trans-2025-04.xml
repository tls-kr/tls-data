[14:12]Jau and Ngwei were Jin successor states after 0403 (note the anachronism);Tvng and Sywe were tiny statelets south of Lu. The implication is that MvngGung-chwd (said to have been head of the Mvng clan in Confucius*s time)was a minor talent, unfit for high office, who deserved to lose his local power.Mencius, also surnamed Mvng, left Chi in 0313 after giving bad adviceto its King on intervening in Yen. By 0310 he may already have become advisorto the future Prince of tiny Tvng. Is the Lu school, perhaps envying his big-stateearly career, here metaphorically jeering at the small-state end to that career?</seg>

As his nameimplies (the prefix Dz- 4&lt;Ybung Master” seems to have been reserved for thesocially advantaged), he had the appropriate background for a court career.According to LY 6:14 (and 17:3) he had been Steward ofWu-chvng, the Princeof Lu's stronghold city at the southeni edge of Lu. On his return to the capitalfrom Wu-chvng, he seems to have taken charge, not of an informal group ofindividual proteges, but of a body of students, preparing for public office in anew and more collective way. The sayings of LY4 seem to have been spokenon isolated occasions, to an individual. The sayings of LY 5 were in many casesobviously said in the hearing of more than one person. No feature of thischapter stands out more strongly than the rivalry among these young hopefuls.LY 5 is the prototypical Conftician schoolroom.Prominent among the hopefuls is the previous leader Dz-gung, who is herepictured as once again under Confucius's tutelage. He is repeatedly (if alsoencouragingly) chided for his pretensions to virtue, and unfavorably comparedwith Confticius's poor relative Yen Hwei.None of the LY 5 sayings can safely be attributed to the actual Confticius,but Dz-you as an early follower may have possessed a fund of family lore thatwas of interest to the new students in the LY 5 school who had never knownConfiicius. Besides these recollections, which are grouped in section A, mostof LY 5 is devoted to the theme of judging men； in that sense it develops 4:3.It is divided into sections according to the status of those judged: (B) theConftician proteges or (C) earlier historical figures. Section D, on the themeof striving for perfection, is a stnictiira) echo of the final section of LY 4.Formally, Dz-you shows himself a master of the parallel-saying stnictiire.Each saying in sections B and C is linked to both the preceding and followingsaying. These linkages are shown by the usual「and L marks at the beginningsof sayings, and by complementary q and」at their ends. For a schematicoverview of these structures, see page 29.Reference numbers to Legge are given at the end of each passage.</seg>

What seemsto have happened next is the emergence of an organized Confucian school,under a new “Master,” perhaps Confucius's early protege Dz-you. As his nameimplies (the prefix Dz- "Young Master” seems to have been reserved for thesocially advantaged), he had the appropriate background for a court career.According to LY 6:14 (and 17:3) he had been Steward of Wu-chvng, the Princeof Lu's stronghold city at the southeni edge of Lu. On his return to the capitalfrom Wu-chvng, he seems to have taken charge, not of an informal group ofindividual proteges, but of a body of students, preparing for public office in anew and more collective way. The sayings of LY 4 seem to have been spokenon isolated occasions, to an individual. The sayings of LY 5 were in many casesobviously said in the hearing of more than one person. No feature of thischapter stands out more strongly than the rivalry among these young hopefuls.LY 5 is the prototypical Confucian schoolroom.Prominent among the hopefuls is the previous leader Dz-gung, who is herepictured as once again under Confucius's tutelage. He is repeatedly (if alsoencouragingly) chided for his pretensions to virtue, and unfavorably comparedwith Confucius's poor relative Yen Hwei.None of the LY 5 sayings can safely be attributed to the actual Confucius,but Dz-you as an early follower may have possessed a fund of family lore thatwas of interest to the new students in the LY 5 school who had never knownConfucius. Besides these recollections, which are grouped in section A, mostof LY 5 is devoted to the theme of judging men； in that sense it develops 4:3.It is divided into sections according to the status of those judged: (B) theConfucian proteges or (C) earlier historical figures. Section D, on the themeof striving for perfection, is a structural echo of the final section of LY 4.Formally, Dz-you shows himself a master of the parallel-saying strtructure.Each saying in sections B and C is linked to both the preceding and followingsaying. These linkages are shown by the usual「and L marks at the beginningsof sayings, and by complementary q and」at their ends. For a schematicoverview of these structures, see page 29.Reference numbers to Legge are given at the end of each passage.</seg>

The wealth of Chi inthis period rested in part on its seacoast salt monopoly.

[5:18b]」Dz-jang drops his example of imperturbability and offers one of intransigence.It probably evoked for him the furious integrity of LY 4, but it also asserts anunfeudal right to judge one*s own superiors. Though psychologically parallel(see 5:11), it uses a different energy, and inhabits a different world, from rvn.Notice the southern focus of these sayings, and the Chu affinities of theearliest figures mentioned in this section. Early Lu communications did looklargely southward： the Lu Prince personally visited Chu in 0545, whereas Yen,the gateway to the northern steppe, is mentioned only rarely in the CC.</seg>

The meaning is quite clear in the historical context.  Confucius admires the intrepid and unselfish 忠 "doing one's unstinting loyal best (for one's)" by Níng, who did ultimately assure the reinstalment of the incompetent ruler to whom he owed his loyalty. It is important for this story that Níng was not seeking employment when the way did not prevail: he is here taken to have loyally continued the service he owed. However the historical facts may have to interpreted in the end, it is clear the Confucius was philosophising about the changing public renommé of Níng, not any changing prudential competence.  The philosophical point deserves close analysis.　The reception history of this also.】</seg>

His wisdom can be equaled, buthis stupidity cannot be equaled. [5:20]」Ning Wudz of Wei (07c), who at great risk gave aid to his imprisoned Prince,came to symbolize principle in adversity, and the word “stupid” (yw 愚)in thesense “heedless of self in the discharge of duty” acquired a cult status, mostfamously exemplified by the Tang poet-official Lyou Dzung-ywin (773-819),an associate of Han Yw and one of the first scholars to approach the Analectsin a spirit of independent inquiry. His “Stupid River” poems and preface ofc810, written in his southern exile under the guise of rueful self-criticism,affirm an unshakable devotion to right principles despite living in wrong times.</seg>
