[14:12]Jau and Ngwei were Jin successor states after 0403 (note the anachronism);Tvng and Sywe were tiny statelets south of Lu. The implication is that MvngGung-chwd (said to have been head of the Mvng clan in Confucius*s time)was a minor talent, unfit for high office, who deserved to lose his local power.Mencius, also surnamed Mvng, left Chi in 0313 after giving bad adviceto its King on intervening in Yen. By 0310 he may already have become advisorto the future Prince of tiny Tvng. Is the Lu school, perhaps envying his big-stateearly career, here metaphorically jeering at the small-state end to that career?</seg>
