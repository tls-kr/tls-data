        <def>Pathological Condition of lou 瘺 , fistula, associated with fever and an aversion to cold. The swelling does not emerge at any fixed location. It opens to fester and develops into fistula. In former times it was believed that snake fistula differs from sparrow fistula in that, after treatment, patients discharge items resembling snakes in their urine. Zhu bing yuan hou lun 諸病源候論 34: 由居處飲食有蛇毒氣，入於腑臟，流於經脈，寒熱結腫，出處 無定，因潰成瘺。服藥，有物隨小便出，如蛇形狀，謂之蛇瘺 , “This is because poisonous qi of snakes encountered at one’s living place, in beverages and food, has entered the depots and palaces whence it has flown into the conduit vessels. [Patients] experience sensations of cold and heat, as well as nodular swelling that appears at no fixed locations. The swelling later begins to fester and develops into fistula. Having ingested medication, [patients] will release items resembling snakes with their urine. [Hence] one calls this ‘ snake fistula ’”.</def>
