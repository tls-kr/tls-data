        <def>Alternative Names ye ji zhi 野雞痔 , wild fowl piles; ye ji lou zhi 野雞瘺痔 , wild fowl fistula piles; ye ji lou chuang 野雞瘺瘡 , wild fowl fistula sore. Pathological Condition identical with zhi 痔 , piles. Ben cao shi yi 本草拾遺 Substance Entry rong shou 狨獸：主五野雞病。 取其脂傅瘡，亦食其血肉，亦坐其皮，積久野雞病皆差也 , “It controls five types of wild fowl disease . Smear its fat on the lesion, eat its blood and meat, and sit on its skin. This will heal wild fowl disease that has lasted for an extended period of time”. The term zhi 痔 , piles, is homophone with the character zhi 雉 constituting the second name of the founder of the Han-dynasty Liu Bang’s wife Lü Zhi 呂雉 . Legend has it that, allegedly to honor the taboo on the term zhi 雉 , pheasant, as well as its homophones such as zhi 痔 , piles, in what appears to have beeen a satirical act the emperor’s wife was likened to the disease of hemorrhoids in that the latter was designated with the characters for “wild fowl”, ye ji 野雞 , alluding to the “pheasant” ( zhi 雉 ) as a fowl living in the wilderness. In later times people may have forgotten these etymological origins and spoke of ye ji zhi 野雞痔 , wild fowl piles, to clarify the meaning of the term.</def>
