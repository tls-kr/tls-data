        <def>Pathological Condition of lou 瘺 , fistula, with swelling developing on one’s neck at three or four, or four or five places. In severe cases the entire chest is swollen. Eventually the swelling opens to fester and develop into fistula with the appearance of obstruction-illnesses. When healed to close at one place they will once again effuse at another place. Zhu bing yuan hou lun 諸病源候論 34: 蜂瘺者，由飲食勞倦，渴乏多飲流水，即得蜂 毒，流入於臟。其根在脾。出發於頸項，歷歷三四處，或累累四五處蜂 台，或發胸前俱腫，以潰生瘡，狀如癰形，瘥而復移 , “The origin of bee fistula lies in one’s food and exhaustion. If someone is tired and thirsty and often drinks running water, and then is affected by the poison of bees, this will flow into the depots. From its root in the spleen it effuses at the front and back of the neck. Either at three or four places, or at four or five places, resembling a wild honeycomb. Or it may effuse in front of the chest which then is entirely swollen. When it festers it develops into sores of the appearance of obstruction-illnesses. After being healed it re-appears somewhere else”.</def>
