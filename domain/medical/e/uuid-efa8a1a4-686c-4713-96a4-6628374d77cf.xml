        <def>Illness Sign Combined Designation of all types of redundancy growths in the nape. Yi shuo 醫說 6: 華亭有一老僧， 昔行脚河南管下，寺僧僮僕無一不病癭。時有洛僧共寮，每食取攜行苔 脯同餐。經數月，僧項贅盡消，若未嘗病。寺僧訝嘆，乃知海岸咸物， 能愈是疾 , “In Hua ting there was an old monk. Once he travelled in the jurisdiction of Henan. The monks in the monasteries, and all their servants – not a single one of them did not have a goiter. At one time he shared the hut with the monks from Luo. For meals he took them to consume dried meat prepared from algae. After several months had passed, the monks’ nape redundancy had completely disappeared, as if they had never had a disease. The monks sighed with astonishment. Now they knew that salty items from the coast were able to cure this ailment”.</def>
