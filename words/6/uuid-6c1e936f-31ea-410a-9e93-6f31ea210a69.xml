            <def>Gōnggōng 共工 (legendary) was said to a rebellious Minister of Works in high antiquity, a descendent of &gt;Emperor Yan 炎帝. A mythical creature of his name is often represented as having the face of a human and the body of a snake, sporting red hair and riding on two dragons. HNZ shows an extraordinary interest in this legendary figure: He was punished by Emperor Zhuanxu 顓頊 for causing flood catastrophies. [HNZ 8.8a, 15.1b]  He denied the authority of the early emperors. [HNZ 1.3a, 3.1b] He is said to have been drowned by &gt;Emperor Yao. [HNZ 19.2a] According to XUN 25 he was exiled to the Dark Island by &gt;Emperor Yu; according to MENG 5A3 it was &gt;Emperor Shun who exiled him. SJ 1 describes him as an arch scoundrel.</def>
