            <def>Lěi 耒 is the most ancient form of a typically hand-pulled plough with one (later in Han times two) wooden ploughshare which is held in the hand on an upper cross-bar and stepped on on a lower cross-bar, but this character is rarely used on its own. When in the construction lěi sì 耒耜 this refers to a lěi 耒-type sì 耜, i.e. a shovel-like plough with a long handle and cross-bars to tread on and to hold on to. [It is not easy to distinguish between lěi 耒 and sì 耜 in ancient texts; moreover, as noted above, both terms has a long history and can refer to different implements in different periods. It seems that main distinctions between both were probably originally as follows: lěi 耒 was simple crooked wooden stick with upper and lower cross-bar, whereas sì 耜 more resembled spade with broader head (see above). The latter could be also used to dig earth, and sometimes can not be easily distinguished from chā 臿. Already in the Chunqiu period, lěi 耒 and sì 耜 were combined together, and this implement can be referred to as lěi 耒, sì 耜, or lěi sì 耒耜. Since its handle was more lěi 耒-like, and its head more sì 耜-like, the word lěi 耒 can also refer to the handle of the implement, and sì 耜 to its head. In Han times, all these terms can refer to a plough generally (including oxen-pulled plough of the lí3 犁 type; see below), or specifically to each kind of implement which were just described, and which all survived to the Han period.
