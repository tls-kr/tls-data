<p>'National Master' is a honorific appellation for meritorious monks bestowed by the Emperor (rarely it specifically refers to a monk's office). The term dates back to the Northern Qi (550-577) and was for the first time bestowed on the monk Fa3cha2ng 法常 by Emperor We2nxua1n 文宣 in 550 because of his merits in lecturing on the NIRVANA (see Fo2-zu3 to3ng-ji4 佛祖統紀). Around the same time also the monk Fa3sha4ng 法上 who had the office of managing nationwide monastic affairs received this honorary title. There is also some early reference to the term during the Northern Zhou (557-581). Although this is the first appearance of this term in the Chinese context, there are also some references in suutra texts, i.e. 'National Maste' probably was an appellation already used in India and Central Asia (see YANG WEIZHONG 2001: 100). During the Tang the term continued to be used as an honorific appellation for especially meritorious monks. This appellation was not restricted to monks of a certain school; however, the title was given only on rare occasions. In the Cha2n/Zen School the first monk who received this title was She2nxiu4 神秀 who had close contacts to Empress Wu3 武 and to the succeeding emperors Zho1ngzo1ng 中宗, Rui4zo1ng 睿宗 and Xua2nzo1ng 玄宗. The next was Hui4a1n 慧安 who was given the appellation 'National Master La3oa1n 老安', afterwards followed Hui4zho1ng 慧忠 (Na2nya2ng guo2-shi1 南陽國師) and Zhi1xua2n 知玄 who was revered as 'National Master Wu4da2 悟達' (on guo2-shi1 from schools other than the Cha2n school see ibid.: 101). During the Five Dynasties the practice of bestowing this title was continued in some of the small states in the south. On the bestowment of this title after the Song see ibid.: 101-105.</p>
