            <def>Biăn Hé 卞和 (8th century), from the state of Chu 楚 [CC 13.3; HNZ 14.15a], also known as He Shi 和氏 “Mr He” is referred to as Mr He of Jing 荊和氏 in CC 16.5. The story is told that he presented what he considered as a precious piece of jade to King Li of Chu 楚厲王 (758 - 741) and then to King Wu of Chu 楚武王 (r. 740 – 690), but his present was rejected in both cases: his precious offering was declared to be a vulgar stone, and he was punished with extreme mutilations. He is said to have wept tears of blood, but his third attempt is said to have been successful [HNZ 19.17b]. The “jade of Mr He” became proverbial in later Chinese literature, but it seems nowhere mentioned in the early Confucian texts or in LSCQ. HF was fascinated by this story and refers to it several times.  HNZ and SJ are also clearly preoccupied by the case. [MO 11; ZGC Zhao 1; SY 17.10; XINXU 1.19, 5.141; [HF 13; 20]</def>
