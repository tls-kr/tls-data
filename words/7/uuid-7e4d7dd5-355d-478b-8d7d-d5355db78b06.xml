  <def resp="#CH" updated="2020-04-17T20:25:08.094+09:00">Chŭ Gōng Wáng 楚共王 (601-560, r. 590-560), son of King Zhuang of Chu 楚莊王, acceded to the throne at the age of ten, and the affairs of government were taken care of for him by Zi Zhong 子重. In 585 his important dignitary Xi Gong 析公 left him to serve his arch enemy, the state of Jin晉. In 579 he signed an important peace treaty with his military arch enemy, the state of Jin. In 575 he suffered an ignominious defeat at the hands of Jin in the battle of Yanling 鄢陵 when he was shot with an arrow  in the eye, according to the account in SJ 40.1703. As a result of this heavy defeat, Chu entered a phase of reduced power. In the 18th year of his reign he joined the state of Zheng in a major successful attack on Song where he left behind 300 war chariot to keep control over the territory of which he had gained control, thus cutting off the immediate links between the states of Wu and of Jin. He had five sons Zi Zhao 子招, &gt;Zi Yu 子圉 (who became King Ling of Chu when he assassinated the ruling king in 540), Zi Gan 子干, Zi Xi 子晳, and &gt;Qi Ji 棄疾. [LH 9.11] The bloodbath surrounding King Gong’s succession is described in lurid detail in SJ 40.1709.　Father of &gt;Chǔ Kāng wáng 楚康王, &gt;Chǔ Líng wáng 楚靈王</def>
