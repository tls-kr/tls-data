            <def>Gŭsŏu 瞽瞍 (or 瞽叟) (legendary) was said to be the father of &gt;Emperor Shun 舜. [Meng 6A6] Gusou became Master of Music specialising in the many-stringed se 瑟 instrument under &gt;Emperor Yao defining the number of strings used on that instrument. He was satisfied with his son’s filial conduct. [MENG 4A28] He ceased to behave as his subject when he had become emperor. [MENG 5A4] If Gusou had committed a murder, Shun would have apprehended him for the crime. [MENG 7A35] It is said that Shun preferred a second son by a second wife to Gusou and repeatedly tried to kill Gusou. SY 6.7 has Confucius comment on the relation between Gusou and his father.
