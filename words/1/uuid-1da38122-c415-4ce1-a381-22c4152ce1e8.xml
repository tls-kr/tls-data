Duke Huan accused him of having failed to pay his tribute to the royal house of Zhou 周. In the years that follow King Cheng launched a long series of attacks against minor states. In 639 he even went so far as to capture King Xiang of Song 宋襄王 (650-637) who had ambitions to succed Duke Huan of Qi as the hegemon, but he set him free after having humiliated him. In 637 he laid on a lavish reception for the Chong Er 重耳, the future &gt;Duke Wen of Jin 晉文公. In 633 King Cheng joined an alliance to attack Qi as well as Song and ends up establishing himself as the leading personality among the Warring States. In the 46th year of his reign he tried to disinherit his crown prince but was in turn attacked by the latter and was forced to strangle himself in 626.
