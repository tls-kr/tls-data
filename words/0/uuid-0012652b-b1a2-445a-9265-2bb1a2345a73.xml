  <def resp="#CH" updated="2020-04-18T00:18:49.961+09:00">Chŭ Zhāo Wáng 楚昭王 (r. 515 - 489) was less than ten years old when he succeeded his father &gt;King Ping of Chu 楚平王 (r. 528-516). When the state of Wu invaded Chu in 506 and entered the capital, King Zhao had to flee and was injured in the process. He regained his capital a year later. He is very well attested in the early sources because of his supposed interest in Confucius. His supporter Shen Baoxu 申包胥 begged Qin for military help. When this was refused he went to the Qin palace and wailed there continuously for seven days. Shen Baoxu is celebrated in SJ 40 for refusing any reward for his extreme loyal effort. In the end, Duke Ai of Qin 秦哀公 sent troops and defeated Wu. ZHUANG 28 has the story of a butcher who followed Duke Zhao on his flight. HSWZ 2.14 reports on King Zhao’s loyal minister Shi She 石奢. LNZ 4.10 praises his chaste wife Jiang 姜. Another wife of his is praised in LNZ 5.4. King Zhao died of a sudden illness in one of the interminable conflicts with the state of Wu in 489 as he was coming to the rescue his ally, the state of Chen 陳. Even on his deathbed he is said to have carefully avoided breaking with traditional ritual. Confucius is reported to have commended him for this: 「楚昭王通大道矣。其不失國，宜哉！」SY 17.15, basing itself on the same source as does SJ 47.1932, claims that Duke Zhao intended to invite Confucius to take over the reins of government, but that &gt;Zi Xi 子西 successfully argued against this.
