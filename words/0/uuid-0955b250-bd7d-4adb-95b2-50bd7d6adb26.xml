            <def>伯里子 (7th century) from the state of Chu, mostly referred to as Bo Lixi 百里奚 or as Bo Lizi 百里子, was a cowherd from the tiny state of Yu 虞, and according to HSWZ 8.25 even a beggar, who was taken prisoner when &gt;Duke Xian of Jin 晉獻公 (r. 676-651) destroyed that small state of Yu in 655. Bo Lizi was repeatedly resold (百里奚轉鬻), as HNZ 19.3b puts it memorably. SJ 83.2743 reports that he was a beggar until he was brought into politics by Duke Mu of Qin 秦穆公 (r. 659 - 621). He sold himself for for five sheep-skins to Duke Mu of Qin according to HSWZ 7.6.  SJ 39.1653 has him in conversation with Duke Mu of Qin. A remarkable case of social mobility in ancient China, he became a reform-minded prime minister who helped that duke dominate the neighbouring states. [HNZ 10.11b] He is often mentioned on a par with &gt;Guan Zhong 管仲 (d. 643) who played a similar role in the service of &gt;Duke Huan of Qi 齊桓公.</def>
