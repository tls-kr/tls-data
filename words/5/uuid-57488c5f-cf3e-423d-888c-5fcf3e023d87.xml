            <def>Fàn 范/笵 also refers to a mould. I have not found any evidence that it was made of bamboo; XUNZI refers to the fàn 范/笵 which is together with xíng 型 used to cast metal sword, and it is highly improbable for a bamboo mould to be used to cast metal. WANG suggests that fàn 范/笵 refers to the moulds made of metal, but I have not found anything to support this opinion. Perhaps the word is only another term for xíng 型, or it refers to a bamboo mould for things other than metal.
