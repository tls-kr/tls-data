            <def>Guăn Shū 管叔 (11th century), often referred to more speciafically as 管叔鮮 was a younger brother of &gt;King Wu of Zhou and son of &gt;King Wen of Zhou. After the victory of King Wu of Zhou over the Shang Guan Shu was enfeoffed in Guan 管 to oversee the survivors of the Shang 商. But when King Wu died and &gt;King Cheng of Zhou 周成王 (r. 1042-1020) ascended the throne as a minor, Guan Shu and his brother &gt;Cai Shudu 蔡叔度 conspired with the sons of the last Shang emperor Zhòu 紂 against King Wu’s heir, King Cheng of Zhou, who was then a child. They were suppressed by another of their brothers, Duke Dan of Zhou 周公旦, commonly referred to simply as the &gt;Duke of Zhou 周公 who acted as guardian to the then still minor King Cheng of Zhou.
