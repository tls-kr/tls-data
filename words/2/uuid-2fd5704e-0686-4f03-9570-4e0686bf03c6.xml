            <def>Qín 秦 (CHEN PAN 1969, 178-196)

Clan: Yíng 贏 (also written as or Yǎn 偃).

Rank: Bó 伯 (common in CQ). In the inscriptions on the bronze artifacts, rulers of Qín also refers to themselves as gōng 公. In 324 B.C., the ruler of Qín adopted the title wáng 王.

Founded: According to the tradition recorded in the Qín shìjiā chapter of SHI and in the Guó yǔ (Zhèng yǔ), rulers of Qín were descendants of the mythical Bóyī  伯翳 (or Bóyì 伯益), who served to the muthical emperor Shùn 舜. His descendant Fēizǐ 非子 received the fief in Qín from the Zhōu King Xiào 周孝王(ca 872?-866 B.C.). Later, in 770 B.C., lord Xiāng (&gt;Qín Xiāng gōng 秦襄公) was raised into the rank of zhūhóu 諸侯 by King Píng of Zhou (&gt;Zhōu Píng wáng 周平王) because of his assistence to the king during his removal of the capital to the East.

Destroyed: In 221 B.C. Qín united all the states of the Chinese cultural sphere into one empire and established Qin dynasty which was overthrown in 206 B.C.

Location: The state of Qín basically controlled the Wèi渭 River valley in the modern Shǎnxī province and the eastern part of Gansu province. The first capital of Fēizǐ was Qín 秦, which is located by the Kuò dì zhì into the area of the modern Tiānshuǐ 天水, Gansu province. During the reign of lord Níng 秦寧公 (715-704 B.C.) it moved to Píngyáng 平陽 (supposed to be located in the western part of modern Méi 眉 district, Shaanxi province), and later - in 677 B.C. - to Yōng 雍(modern Fēngxiáng 風翔, Shaanxi). Eventually, in 350, the capital was shifted to Xiányáng 咸陽(to the northeast of modern Xiányáng 咸陽, Shaanxi).

History: During the decades following its establishment Qín reconquered ancient Zhōu territories in the West. In the Chunqiu period Qín reached in the second half of the 7th century B.C. it reached the height of its power under the duke Mù (&gt;Qín Mù gōng秦穆公 , 659 - 621 B.C.) who became a hegemon among the "western barbarians". At a conference in 546, Qín was recognized to be one of the four strongest states in China. After the reforms of &gt;Shāng Yāng 商鞅 (between 356 - 338 Qín) grew in power, and in 324 the ruler of Qín accepted the title of wáng 王"king". Thereafter Qín gradually defeated the remaining "warring" states and in 221 B.C. united China. The Qín dynasty was neverthless short-lived, and in 206 it was overthrown.
