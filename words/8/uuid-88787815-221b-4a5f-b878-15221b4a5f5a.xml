            <def>Chì Sōng 赤松 (legendary, no dates) also called 赤松子, in HNZ 9 赤誦子, is a widely acclaimed immortal, traditionally identified with the deity Master of Rain 雨師. Xu Shen’s commentary on HNZ 12 reports that he left for the mountains because he fell ill, and that he practised the art of levitation. He is said to have lived during the time of the Divine Husbandman &gt;Shen Nong 神農. CC praises him as having purified himself of the dust of this world. (tr. Hawkes p. 194). In CC 11.1 and 14.1 he is mentioned, as often elsewhere, together with &gt;Wang Qiao 王喬. HSWZ 5.27 has him as the teacher of &gt;Emperor Ku 帝嚳. He is said to be in charge of rainfall and also a specialist in respiratory techniques. In Liexianzhuan 列仙傳 [ed. Kaltenmark 1987, 35, ed. Wang Shumin p. 1] he is celebrated in the opening entry as being able to walk through fire and as frequenting Xiwangmu 西王母 . The youngest daughter of Emperor Yan of the Shang 商炎帝 is said to have pursued him amorously and to have achieved immortality that way. [HNZ 11.13b and 20.10a, BHT 15, tr. Tjan p. 483]</def>
