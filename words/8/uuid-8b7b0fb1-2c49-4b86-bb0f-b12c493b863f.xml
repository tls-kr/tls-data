            <def>Lí 犁 is a plough driven, originally, by three people, one guiding the plough-share, the other two pulling the plough. The plow-pullers were replaced by oxen at the stage where the modern current character was developed. The lí 犁 currently pulled by oxen by Han times had iron plough shares. [It is not clear when this kind of plough came to use. Some scholars interpret finds of triangular stone implements known from the Neolithic like evidence for this kind of plough, but it should be noted that all these artefacts come from the southern part of China, far apart from the core area of the later states of the 2nd and 1st millenium B.C. In fact, from northern China there is no convincing evidence for this kind of plough prior to the late Chunqiu. Moreover, it is not clear when the plough began to be pulled by an oxen; the oldest evidence for a pulling oxen also dates from the late Chunqiu period. In the Warring States and particularly in the Han, oxen-pulled plough came to common use, and there are many finds of iron ploughshares from these periods. It should be noted that even in that time, this kind of plough was not ussually referred to as lí3 犁 in texts, but rather as lěi 耒 or sì 耜. The term lí3 犁 was probably a colloquial word.

            <def>Lí 犁 refers specifically to ploughing the fields with a sharp-edged rather than pointed plough.
