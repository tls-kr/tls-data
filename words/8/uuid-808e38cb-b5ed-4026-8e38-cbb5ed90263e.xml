            <def>Xiǎo Zhū 小邾 (also called Xiǎo Zhū 小朱, Xiǎo Zhūlóu 小邾婁, or Ní 郳) (CHEN PAN 1969, 281-284)

Clan: Cáo 曹 (according to the ZUO, Guó yǔ - Zhèng yǔ - and to the Shì běn).

Rank: Zǐ 子 (common in the CQ).

Founded: The state was founded by Yǒu 友, the son of Duke Wén of Zhū 邾文公 (according to the Dù pǔ). In the Shì běn, the founder of Xiǎo Zhū is called Féi 肥.

Destroyed: Xiǎo Zhū was still in existence by the end of the period recorded in the CQ. Six generations later, the state was destroyed by Chǔ 楚.

Location: The capital of Xiǎo Zhū is said to be located in the modern Téng 滕 district, Shandong province (according to the Du's commentary to the ZUO Zhuang 5, and to the Guó míng jì).
