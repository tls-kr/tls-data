<p>Gua1nxi1n 觀心 or ka4nxi1n 看心 啍o contemplate the mind� is a meditation method which was popular in the end of the 7th and the beginning of the 8th century in Cha2n circles. A description of this method appears in the Ru4da4o a1nxi1n ya4o fa1ngbia4n fa3me2n 入道安心要方便法門 which is included in the Le2ngqie2 shi1zi1 ji4 楞伽師資記 by Ji4ngjue2 淨覺 (683-?), one of the earliest transmission texts of the Cha2n school which was discovered among the Du1nhua2ng Cha2n manuscripts. The Ru4da4o a1nxi1n ya4o fa1ngbia4n fa3me2n is regarded as a product of Da4oxi4n who retrospectively became the 陟ourth Patriarch� of the Cha2n school. In this text ka4nxi1n is described as �...to view the mind which is neither within nor without and which is none other than Buddha.� (CHAPPELL 1983: 99). The term ka4nxi1n is also closely connected to the term yi1xi2ng sa1nme4i 一行三昧 (TERM) 唼amaadhi of One Practice� (see FAURE 1986(a); on the term see also KOBAYASHI 1961).  At the time of the composition of ZTJ the proponents of the early Cha2n movement in the late 7th and early 8th century were already stereotypically classified as members of the 偡orthern School� who advocated the teaching of 偑radual enlightenment�. However, the method of gua1nxi1n/ka4nxi1n was used by the monk Mo2he2ya2n (who had close associations to the Northern School) to defend the concept of 唼udden enlightenment� at the famous Council of Lhasa where Chinese and Indian monks debated about the nature of enlightenment. In the ZHENGLIJUE Mo2he2ya2n defined ka4n-xi1n as 勓on-reflection and non-eximination� (bu4 si1 bu4 gua1n 不思不觀): 浟...] To turn the light of the mind towards the mind掇 source - that is contemplating the mind. This means that one does not reflect or examine whether conceptual signs are in movement or not. It also means to reflect on non-reflection. This is why the [Vimalakiirti-nirdesSa] suutra emplains: 勓on-examination is enlightenment.梌 (ZHENGLIJUE, Pelliot 4546, folio 135a; Pelliot 116, folio 161; cit. in Gomez 1987: 103-104; see also DEMIEVILLE 1952: 78ff; RUEGG 1989: 203-204; on Mo2he2ya2n see GOMEZ 1987: 153, fn. 119 and 154, fn. 124). The term also appears in other texts of the early Cha2n school (see for example Da4-she4ng xi1n-xi2ng lu4n 大乘心行論, PELLIOT 3559, folio 28, line 14 (see ANDERL 1995: 84 and 90, fn. 412). At the time of the composition of ZTJ many of the literary works of the Early Cha2n school probably were already lost or suppressed.</p>
