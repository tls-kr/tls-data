            <def>Jiǎ 斝 is generally used as a term for a bronze vessel with three legs and round opening which was used to heat and serve wine. This type of vessel was common in the Shang and Western Zhou periods and came out of use in the late Western Zhou. Attribution of the name to this kind of vessel is not certain, but probable. In the Eastern Zhou and Han texts, jiǎ 斝 refers to the wine vessel, the content of which should be greater than in the case of jué 爵. [???The word seems to be rather rare in the Eastern Zhou and Han, and it occurs (except one mention in ZUO] in texts like YILI, SHUOWEN, as well as in commentaries; it cannot be thus excluded that its usage is some kind of archaization.
