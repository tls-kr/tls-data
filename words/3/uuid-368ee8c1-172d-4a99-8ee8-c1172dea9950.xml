            <def>Yān 燕 (originally - on the bronzes - written as Yǎn 匽偃郾; also called Běi Yān 北燕. Distinguish from &gt;Nán Yān 南燕) (CHEN PAN 1969, 154-166)

Clan: Ruled by the Jī 姬 clan.

Rank: Bó 伯 (common in CQ and ZUO). In SHI (Yàn shìjiā chapter), the rulers of Yàn are usually referred to as hóu 侯. The same designation also appears in the inscriptions on the bronzes. In some of the inscriptions, rulers of Yàn are referred to as gōng　公.

Founded: Established in the second half of the eleventh century under the reign of king Chéng of Zhōu (&gt;Zhōu Chéng wáng 周成王), where Yàn was given as a fief to the Duke of Shào 召公, and then ruled by his son. This is also attested by the inscriptions on the bronzes.

Destroyed: Eliminated in 222 BC by the state of &gt;Qín 秦.

Location: Located in modern Hebei Province.
The first capital was located at modern Liúlíhé 流璃河, Fángshān 房山 district, about 100 kilometres to the south of Beijing. There the walled city and the cemetery of the Yàn aristocracy, belonging to the early Western Zhōu period, was excavated. Thereafter, still in the Western Zhōu period, it moved to Jì 薊 , probably located to the southwest of modern Beijing (according to the Hàn shū Dì lǐ zhì). According to the Shìjiā jìjiě (quoting Shì běn), during the reign of Marquis Huán 燕桓侯 (697-691 B.C.), the capital of Yàn shifted to Línyì 臨易 (probably in the modern Běixióng 　　北雄 district, Hebei province). During the Warring States period, the capital moved to Yàn Xiàdū 燕下都 (in the modern Yī district in Hebei province). Exact time of its establishment is not known, but - judging from the excavated artefacts - it was in use in the third century BC.  

History: Yàn was during the Western Zhōu and Chunqiu periods the remote state, which almost did not intervene into the struggles in the northern China, and was very rarely mentioned in ZUO. However, during the fourth century B.C., Yàn became more and more powerful, and during the reign of the King Zhāo 燕昭王 (311-279 B.C.), it beecame one of the most powerful states in China (particularly after its victory over the state of Qí in 284 B.C.). Eventually, in 222 B.C., it was conquered by Qín.
