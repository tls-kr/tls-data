            <def>Sòng (also called Yīn 殷, Shāng 商) (CHEN PAN 1969, 232-241)

Clan: Ruled by the Zǐ 子 clan.

Rank: Gōng (common in CQ and ZUO). This high title was due to the special prestige which the rulers of Sòng enjoyed as the descendants of the Shāng dynasty. In the Zhanguo period, the rulers of Sòng were also sometimes referred to as hóu (for instance in SHI, Liù guó nián biǎo). The last ruler of Sòng, Yǎn, adopted the title of wáng in 318 BC.

Founded: The first ruler of Sòng (enfeoffed by King Wǔof Zhōu (&gt;Zhōu Wǔ wáng 周武王) was Wēizǐ 微子, the son of Shang king &gt;Dì Yǐ 商王帝乙. This received his fief during the reign of &gt;King Chéng 成王.

Destroyed: Conquered by the &gt;Qí 齊 in 286 B.C.

Location: The state of Sòng was located in eastern part of Henan and western Shandong. The capital was Shāngqiū 商丘 (modern Shāngqiū 商丘 in Henan).

History: In the eighth century B.C., Sòng belonged together with &gt;Zhèng 鄭, &gt;Wèi 衛, &gt;Lǔ 魯and &gt;Qí 齊 among the most important states of the early Chunqiu period. Then, during the second half of the seventh century the state of Sòng gradually declined in power, and became a vassal state of &gt;Jìn 晉, shortly before the battle of Chéngpú in 632 B.C.. In 286 B.C., it was eliminated by Qí.
