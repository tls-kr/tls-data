  <def resp="#CH" updated="2020-04-18T22:26:24.93+09:00">Gān Mào 甘茂 (late third cent.), like many political activists of the Warring States period, was highly mobile, and had a varied career which is recorded in considerable detail in ZGC. Having been born in Chŭ he entered Qi on the recommendation of &gt;Zhang Yi 張儀 (d. 309 or 312)，and he became a Qin general. In 309 he came to serve as prime minister in the state of Qín under &gt;King Wŭ of Qín 秦武王 (r. 310 - 307).  Having been slandered there he fled first to the state of Qí, came to his native Chŭ, and ended up in Wei 魏, where he died.  His story is told chronologically in the biography devoted to him in SJ 71. Anecdotes about him abound throughout ZGC.　Unger no. 266</def>
