  <def resp="#CH" updated="2020-04-17T23:55:52.673+09:00">Chŭ Píng Wáng 楚平王 (r. 528 - 516) was the fifth son of &gt;King Gong of Chu 楚共王. Having ascended the throne through a long series of murderous intrigues he followed the standard policy of 施惠寬民 “generosity and lenience towards the people”, declared even a moratorium of military campaigns abroad for a period of five years. He gave back independence to a large number of small polities that had been conquered by his more belligerent predecessors. In many of his inevitable battles against the neighbouring state of Wu he was unsuccessful. Later, in a symbolic political act, he obtained a wife from Qin for his eldest son, but he grew so desperately fond of her that he took her over as his own consort. Listening to advice from &gt;Fei Wuji 費無極 he had the heir apparent’s official tutor Wu She &gt;伍奢 (as well as two of Wu’s sons) killed. &gt;Wu Zixu 伍子胥 managed seek refuge in the state of Wu 吳. Ten years after King Ping’s death Wu Zixu lead the forces of the state of Wu to besiege the capital of Chu. He unearthed King Ping’s body, and had King Ping’s remains flogged in public.
