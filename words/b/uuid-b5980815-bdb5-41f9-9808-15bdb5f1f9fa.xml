            <def>Yōu 鄾 (also written as 優) (CHEN PAN 1969, 447-449)

Clan: Unknown. According to the Lù shǐ Hòu jì and Guó míng jì, the rulers of Yōu should have been of the Màn 曼 surname.

Rank: Uncertain. According to the Tōng diǎn and Lù shǐ Guó míng jì, the rulers of Yōu had zǐ 子 rank.

Founded: Unknown. Some traditional Chinese scholars suppose that the rulers of the state of Yōu were of the same ancestry as those of the neighboring and stronger state of Dèng 鄧.

Destroyed: Unknown. In 477 B.C. (Ai 18), when the city of Yōu was attacked by the army of Bà 巴, it already belonged to Chǔ 楚.

Location: In the area of modern Xiāngyáng 襄陽, northern Hubei province.

History: In the ZUO, Yōu is mentioned only one time, in 703 B.C. (Huan 9), when the people of Yōu murdered Chǔ messengers going to the visit to the state of Dèng. Thereafter, Yōu was attacked by Chǔ and - although Dèng sent an army to rescue it - defeated. It is even not certain whether Yōu was an independent state or a petty town of Dèng.
