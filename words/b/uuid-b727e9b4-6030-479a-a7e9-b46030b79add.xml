            <def>Móu 牟 (also written as 侔; probably identical with Gēn Móu 根牟) (CHEN PAN 1969, 492-496)

Clan: Unknown.

Rank: Uncertain. According to the Fēngsú tōng and Xìng yuàn, the rulers of Móu were of zǐ 子 rank.

Founded: Unknown.

Destroyed: Uncertain. Gēn Móu was conquered by Lǔ in 600 B.C. (Xuan 9; recorded in the CQ). However, Hòu Hàn Rú lín states that Móu was destroyed by Lǔ in the end of the Chunqiu period. Lù shǐ Guó míng jì mentions that Móu was conquered by Chǔ 楚.

Location: Several locations of Móu were suggested by traditional Chinese historiography. According to the Hàn zhì, Shuǐ jīng Wènshuǐ zhù, Du's commentary to the ZUO, and to the Lù shǐ Guó míng jì, Móu was located in the modern Láiwú 萊蕪 district, Shandong province. Tōng diǎn locates it into the modern Pénglái 蓬萊 district in the same province, and Tōng zhì into the Móupíng 牟平 district of the same province. Other place names associated with Móu are found in the Yíshuǐ 沂水 district and Ānqiū 安丘 district. It is difficult to decide which of these opinions is correct (the state could shift several times); at least, it is certain that Móu was located somewhere in the neighborhood of Lǔ.
