            <def>Fàn Wénzĭ  范文子 (d. 574), also known as Shì Xiè 士燮, was the son of Shi Hui 士會, a dignitary in the state of Jin 晉.  ZUO Cheng 2 praises him for insisting on a late return from a victorious battle against the state of Qi in 589 on the grounds that if he had returned early the honour for the victory would all have been his and not the army’s. His typical role in the old sources is throughout that of a wise adviser. In 575 he is said to have advised against an a military campaign by Jin against the state of Zheng 鄭.
