            <def>Chŭ Shī 褚師 (fl. 480-470), also known as Shēngzĭ 聲子, was active in Wey 衛 under &gt;Duke Chu of Wey 衛出公 (r. 492 – 481, and c. 477 - c. 456). In 479 he had to flee to his family home in Song 宋 after attempting an unsuccessful court intrigue. [ZUO Ai 16] In 470, having been humiliated by his ruler, he joined a revolt by dignitaries in Wey. Chu Shi had been attending a party hosted by Duke Chu, when he got onto a sitting mat without taking his socks off. This offended the Duke so much that he proposed Chu Shi should have his feet cut off. [ZUO Ai 25] Chu Shi is expelled. We learn no more about him after this episode, but one of his co-conspirators had his tomb dug up and his body burnt when Duke Chu returned to power after a few years. </def>
