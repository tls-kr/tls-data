<p>Zhi4ya2n was a person from Da1nya2ng 丹陽 and his family name was Hua2 華. He was more than 40 years old when he became a monk. His first teacher was Cha2n master Ba3oyue4 寶月 from Shu1zho1u 舒州, Mt. Go1ng 公山. He studied all kinds of meditation techniques. At an advanced age he returned to Jia4nye4 建業. He settled in the city Shi2to2u 石頭城. It is said that he spent his time there cleaning the wounds and clothes of people afflicted with pestilence. He eventually died there. It is difficult to establish an actual historical link to Niu2tou2 牛頭.</p>
