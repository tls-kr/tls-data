  <def resp="#CH" updated="2020-04-17T16:33:04.424+09:00">Cháng Hóng 萇弘 (6th – 5th centuries) was said to have been a talented minister and archivist shi 史 under King Jing of Zhou 周景王 (r. 544-520) and his successor King Ji4ng of Zhou 周敬王. In 510/9 he was involved in the the building of a protective wall for the Zhou 周 capital. Chang Hong was killed by the people of Zhou in 492, as recounted in ZUO Ai 3. He was considered unusually intelligent (HNZ 10.14b), albeit distinctly inferior to Confucius. (HNZ 9.31a) He was able to predict future good or bad fortune, (HNZ 11.18b), and was also renowned for his astronomical knowledge. (HNZ 13.16b-17b) In Han times a book in 15 scrolls bearing his name was preserved in the imperial library, but this book is no longer extant. A historical popular tale has it that his blood congealed to jade because of the injustice of the treatment he received: “In the times of &gt;King Ling of Zhou 周靈王, Chang Hong was killed.  The people of Shu thereupon stored away the blood he had shed, and in three years it transformed itself into jade.” [Soushen ji 搜神記, DeWoskin 1996, 126]. [ZUO Zhao 32, Ding 1; GY, Chou 3; LSCQ 14.8, 18.3, 18.4; ZHUANG 10, 26. See SY 13.43, ed. Xiang Zonglu 1987: 338.]Unger Prosopography no. 36. </def>
