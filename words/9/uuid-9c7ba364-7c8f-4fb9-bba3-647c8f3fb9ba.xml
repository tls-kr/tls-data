  <def resp="#CH" updated="2020-04-17T23:58:15.091+09:00">Chŭ Qĭngxiāng Wáng 楚頃襄王 (r. 298 - 263) is often referred to as King Xiang of Chu 楚襄王. He acceded to the throne as the son of &gt;King Huai of Chu 楚懷王 (r. 328 - 299). As a boy he served as a hostage to the enemy state of Qin. After King Huai was captured by the state of Qin in 299, his son was put on the throne in his place. When Qin learnt of the appointment they launched another attack on Chu, taking 16 cities and killing 50 000 men from Chu. Throughout his reign, King Xiang suffered an unending series of thoroughly humiliating invasions by Qin, including the destruction of his capital and the desecration of the ancestral tombs of the royal house. King Qingxiang was criticised for a luxurious life style. The story goes that the poet Qu Yuan 屈原 protested publicly when King Qingxiang was about to accept the treacherous offer by Qin of a beautiful lady as a gift. (See Hawkes 1962 for discussion on this narrative tradition.) King Qingxiang’s death is dramatised under the year 263 in Zizhitongjian 資治通鑑, an account based on SJ 40.</def>
