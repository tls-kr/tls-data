            <def>Chéng 郕 (also written as 成, or 盛; also called Chéngyáng 郕陽) (CHEN PAN 1969, 369-374)

Clan: Jī姬.

Rank: Bó 伯 (occurs in the both CQ and ZUO under Wen 12).

Founded: In the early Western Zhōu period by Shūwǔ 叔武, the son of the Zhōu King Wén 周文王 (according to the Shǐ jì, Guǎn Cài shìjiā chapter).

Destroyed: Unknown. In 686 B.C. (Zhuang 8), the state surrendered to Qí 齊, but the rulers of Chéng are again mentioned in 578 B.C. (Cheng 13) and in 502 B.C. (Dìng 8). By that period, Chéng was still in existence.

Location: Uncertain. Several locations of Chéng were suggested by traditional Chinese historiography, all within the area of the western Shandong: in the modern Wènshàng 汶上 (Shāndōng tú jīng), Níngyáng 寧陽 (Dì míng kǎolyè based on the Du's commentary), or in the southeastern part of the modern Pú 濮 district, where the later capital Chéngyáng 成陽 should have been located (Kuò dì zhì; Huán yǔ jì).
