            <def>Zhì Bó 智伯 (知伯), Earl of Zhì (died 453), notoriously ambitious and all-powerful Prime Minister Jìn 晉 under Jìn Āi gōng 晉哀公 Duke Āi of Jìn (reigned 456-438). The Earl was ruined in the end by his very ambitions. In 453 he was attacked and killed by a large alliance of forces consisting of his own allies, as he was attacking Xiāngzǐ 襄子 of Zhào 趙 at Jìnyáng 晉陽.
